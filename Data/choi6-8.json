Organification of iodine The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood . \nHowever , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . \nIn the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ; De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) . \nThis iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems . \nIn addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . \nIf tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) . \nIt is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue . \n\nA philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . \nBut a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . \nThe man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . \nBy force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . \nThis is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . \nIts boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking . \n\nThe next question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational policy-makers . \nOn the whole , it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way . \nSeldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn . \nA hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for working-class youth . \nIn situations of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education . \nCampbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve western cities over the period of 1931 - 40 and found  little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence  , as judged by a panel of professional educators who studied the voting records on educational issues . \nThe few cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers , and such issues are not issues of educational policy . \n\n70 North Providence taxpayers made appeals to the board of tax assessors for a review of their 1961 tax assessments during the last two days at the town hall in Centredale . \nThese were the last two days set aside by the board for hearing appeals . \nAppeals were heard for two days two weeks ago . \nAbout 75 persons appeared at that time . \nLouis H. Grenier , clerk of the board , said that the appeals will be reviewed in December at the time the board is visiting new construction sites in the town for assessment purposes . \nThey also will visit properties on which appeals have been made . \nAny adjustments which are made , Mr. Grenier said earlier this month , will appear on the balance of the tax bill since most of the town's taxpayers take the option of paying quarterly with the balance due next year . \nJohn Pezza , 69 , of 734 Hartford Avenue , Providence , complained of shoulder pains after an accident in which a car he was driving collided with a car driven by Antonio Giorgio , 25 , of 12 DeSoto St. , Providence , on Greenville Avenue and Cherry Hill Road in Johnston yesterday . \n\nAnglo-Saxon and Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age . \nHrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at Finnsburg ( lines 1068 - 1159 ) , and improvises the tale of Beowulf's exploits in a complimentary comparison of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund ( lines 871 - 892 ) ; ; Alcinous ' court bard sings of the discovered adultery of Ares and Aphrodite ( Odyssey 8 266-366 ) , and takes up a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens on ( Odyssey 8 499-520 ) . \nNothing in all this is autobiographical : unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith , the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ; the poet of The Odyssey , reputed blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel Demodocus . \nSince none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter , there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition . \nThat such a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey , at least , is hard to deny . \nMilman Parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant Homeric poems are largely formulaic , and was led to postulate that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of Greek epic survived ; ; he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition , and assumed the slightly less likely corollary that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas . \n\nIt is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels . \nNo single explanation is adequate to account for this . \nImprovement , however , is urgent , and at least three things will be needed . \nThe first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses . \nEven beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant systems , both in their general outlines and in many specific details . \nAn advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems , including some of the more unusual types . \n\nLos Angeles in 1957 finally bowed to the skyscraper . \n) And without high density in the core , rapid-transit systems can not be maintained economically , let alone built from scratch at today's prices . \nHowever , the building of freeways and garages can not continue forever . \nThe new interchange among the four Los Angeles freeways , including the grade-constructed accesses , occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land , one-eighth of a square mile , an area about the size of Rockefeller Center in New York . \nIt is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law calls  the highest and best use  of centrally located urban land . \nAs it affects the city's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ; ; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services . \nSubways improved land values without taking away land ; ; freeways boost valuation less ( because the garages they require are not prime buildings by a long shot ) , and reduce the acreage that can be taxed . \n\nA band viscometer is shown in Figure 2 . \nIt consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims . \nThere is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed . \nA tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks . \nIn normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks . \nAfter it has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded . \nBy the use of various weights , data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtained . \nThe instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described . \n"}

? \nThese items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . \nThere does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities . \nWith respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 ( c ) , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation . \nTo this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute . \nIt is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes . \n\nUnemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . \nSome vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . \nCurrent programs The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home economics . \nSince 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . \nThe George-Barden Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith Act . \nThe Health Amendment Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical nurse training . \nThe latest major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden Act . \n\nThere are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory . \nMollusks are a case in point . \nThe shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . \nThough this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . \nThere can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . \nThe deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . \nBy way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence . \n\nThe nation the three-front war At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad . \nAfterward , Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen . \nWhat Herter presented , said Gore , was  not a very encouraging review  . \nThat was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts . \nWhile Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . \n1 ) Cuba . \nHours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery , Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens , plus 120 Cuban employees ) . \nPresident Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately . \n\nMany other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length . \nLaurence M. Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes , and Charles C. Carpenter's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes ( Thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults . \nFelix Kopstein states that  when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length  , but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity . \nIt is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity ; ; he was working with species of Java , so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect . \nCertain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions . \nAdditional records of slow growth have been omitted . \n\nMiami , Fla. , March 17 -- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . \nIndications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage . \nSiebern hits homer Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . \nThen Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock . \nA two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . \nHouse throws wild With one down in the eighth , Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle . \n\nAustin , Texas -- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's  abandoned property  act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . \nDaniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . \nUnder committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . \nBut questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . \nDaniel termed  extremely conservative  his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 . \nHe told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books  since Texas was a republic  . \nIt permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more . \n\nit was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies . \nIt was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies , and with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other . \n5 . \nPoland frontiers . \nWhen the Yalta Conference opened , the American policy of postponing all discussion of Russia's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down . \nStarting in great force late in December , from a line stretching from East Prussia to Budapest , the Red armies had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the Oder , thirty miles from Berlin , and the Upper Danube region was being rapidly overrun , while the Western Allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine . \n\nthe century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law . \nSeveral factors contributed to this change . \nThe Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow . \nHere in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . \nThus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century . \nInternational law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . \nEssentially this imposed two conditions : First , international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; ; second , it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared . \n\nVincent G. Ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant district attorney , it was announced Monday by Charles E. Raymond , District Attorney . \nIerulli will replace Desmond D. Connall who has been called to active military service but is expected back on the job by March 31 . \nIerulli , 29 , has been practicing in Portland since November , 1959 . \nHe is a graduate of Portland University and the Northwestern College of Law . \nHe is married and the father of three children . \nHelping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically , E.M. Martin , assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday night . \n"}

; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired . \nFor a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream . \nFor the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter . \nThe objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ;

; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services . \nSubways improved land values without taking away land ; ; freeways boost valuation less ( because the garages they require are not prime buildings by a long shot ) , and reduce the acreage that can be taxed . \n\nPolyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited . \nThe market today for detergent builders is quite diverse . \nThe best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . \nThese widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50 % by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate . \nIn the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; ; and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised . \nA well-publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder ratio . \n\ntoll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes . \nLong-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward . \nHigher toll rates also are helping boost revenues . \nResult is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative . \nThings are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds . \nTraffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing . \nThat added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates . \n\nThe plant was located west of the Battenkill and south of the location of the former electric light plant . \nThe Manchester Depot Sewer Company issued 214 shares of stock at $ 10 each for construction of a sewer in that locality , and assessments were made for its maintenance . \nIt has given considerable trouble at times and empties right into the Battenkill . \nFire District No. 1 discussed its possible purchase in 1945 , but considered it an unwise investment . \nThe sewer on Bonnet Street was constructed when there were only a few houses on the street . \nAs new homes were built they were connected so that all residences south of School Street are served by it . \nB.J. Connell is the present treasurer and manager . \nThe 1946 town meeting voted to have the Selectmen appoint a committee to investigate and report on the feasibility of some system of sewage disposal and a disposal plant to serve Manchester Center , Depot , and Way's Lane . \n\nthe Midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas . \nThe high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume . \nResearch at Fayette , Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg with loadings from 8 to 120 lb . \nSince experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds . \nRecent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer . \nTheir study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen hr . \nhp . \n\nAustin , Texas -- A Texas halfback who does n't even know the team's plays , Eldon Moritz , ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three games . \nTime stands still every time Moritz , a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran , goes into the field . \nAlthough he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick -- several every Saturday , in fact -- out of football . \nMoritz does n't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl . \nThat's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries . \nHe ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington State . \nMoritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team . \n\nThe nation the three-front war At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad . \nAfterward , Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen . \nWhat Herter presented , said Gore , was  not a very encouraging review  . \nThat was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts . \nWhile Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . \n1 ) Cuba . \n"}

Armour . \nThe bridegroom's children were here for the Christmas holidays and ca n't return . \n\nsentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . \nThe tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . \nThere is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes . \nThus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley's hymns are as follows . \n A charge to keep I have , A God to glorify  . \nIn the tune to which this hymn is most often sung ,  Boylston  , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have . \nDominant stress is of course more than extended duration , and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center on its first syllable rather than its last . \n\nThese societies can expect to face difficult times . \nAs the historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum , their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces , the gaps between rulers and subjects , town and country , will widen ; ; new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence ; ; old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense of direction . \nNational leaders will have to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men's sense of identity . \nFeelings of a community of interest will have to be recreated -- in some of the new nations , indeed , they must be built for the first time -- on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not rely only on shared memories of the past . \nNevertheless , with foresight and careful planning , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing through this stage can be escaped . \nThe United States can help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible . \nOur central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle boldly the tasks which they face . \n\nOrganization : In this publication measurements of interfacial angles of crystals are used to classify and identify chemical substances . \nT.V. Barker , who developed the classification-angle system , was about to begin the systematic compilation of the index when he died in 1931 . \nThe compilation work was undertaken by a number of interested crystallographers in the Department of Mineralogy of the University Museum at Oxford . \nSince 1948 the working headquarters has been the Department of Geology and Mineralogy . \nNumerous cooperating individuals in Great Britain , Holland , the United States , and Belgium have contributed editorially or by making calculations . \nGreat interest and practical help have been given by the Barker Index Committee . \nFinancial and material help have come from academic , governmental , and industrial organizations in England and Holland . \n\nIntroduction . \nIn 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers . \nThese are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol Afj . \nThen in 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( A ) It has no complex of invariant lines , and ( B ) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1 . \nNo generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible . \n1 . \nLet Q be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli Afj and Afj , and let \\*\\* zg be a Afj curve of order K on Q . \n\nThe thermal exchange of chlorine between Afj and liquid Afj is readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180-degrees and above . \nThe photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at 65-degrees using light absorbed only by the Afj . \nIn the gas phase , with Afj of Afj and Afj of Afj , quantum yields of the order of Afj have been observed at 85-degrees . \nDespite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure reagents , serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates of reaction . \nIt appears possible to set a lower limit of about Afj for the activation energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form Afj radical . \nThe rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions . \n\nAustin , Texas -- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's  abandoned property  act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . \nDaniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . \nUnder committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . \nBut questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . \nDaniel termed  extremely conservative  his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 . \nHe told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books  since Texas was a republic  . \nIt permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more . \n"}

Connall who has been called to active military service but is expected back on the job by March 31 . \nIerulli , 29 , has been practicing in Portland since November , 1959 . \nHe is a graduate of Portland University and the Northwestern College of Law . \nHe is married and the father of three children . \nHelping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically , E.M. Martin , assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday night . \nMartin , who has been in office in Washington , D.C. , for 13 months spoke at the council's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel . \nHe told some 350 persons that the United States ' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways , following their own paths . \n\none explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium ( section 381 ( c ) ( 9 ) ) , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section 381 ( c ) ( 16 ) ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section 381 ( c ) ( 6 ) ) , but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company ( section 381 ( c ) ( 14 ) ) , but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes ? ? \nThese items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . \nThere does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities . \nWith respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 ( c ) , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation . \nTo this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute . \nIt is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes . \n\nartists , indeed , turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . \nTo speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . \nAt the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . \nTheir world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . \nAnd perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . \nThe storms of the past had died away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men's minds . \n\nthe three main categories of antisubmarine warfare operations are defense of shipping , defense of naval forces , and area defense . \nThe last category overlaps the others in amphibious operations and near terminals and bases . \nTo effect these operations , five elements exist ( 1 ) surface , ( 2 ) air , ( 3 ) mines , ( 4 ) submarine , and ( 5 ) fixed installations . \nSurface forces have been used to provide defense zones around naval and merchant ship formations , air to furnish area surveillance , and mines for protection of limited areas . \nSubmarines and shore installations are new elements . \nThe submarine now has a definite place in submarine defense particularly in denying enemy access to ocean areas . \nFixed installations offer possibilities for area detection . \n\nLos Angeles in 1957 finally bowed to the skyscraper . \n) And without high density in the core , rapid-transit systems can not be maintained economically , let alone built from scratch at today's prices . \nHowever , the building of freeways and garages can not continue forever . \nThe new interchange among the four Los Angeles freeways , including the grade-constructed accesses , occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land , one-eighth of a square mile , an area about the size of Rockefeller Center in New York . \nIt is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law calls  the highest and best use  of centrally located urban land . \nAs it affects the city's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ; ; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services . \n\nThe Sane Society is an ambitious work . \nIts scope is as broad as the question : What does it mean to live in modern society ? ? \nA work so broad , even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed by a moral vision , must necessarily  fail  . \nEven a hasty reader will easily find in it numerous blind spots , errors of fact and argument , important exclusions , areas of ignorance and prejudice , undue emphases on trivia , examples of broad positions supported by flimsy evidence , and the like . \nSuch books are easy prey for critics . \nNor need the critic be captious . \n\nThe preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined by the sociologist . \nLike primitive numbers in mathematics , the entire axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth . \nBut what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduces the idea of physical models ? ? \nIs it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred canons in social science ? ? \nIt has become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by erecting mathematical and physical models , is itself a conditioned response to a world which pays a premium price for technological manipulation . \nThis push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word  mass  to mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals in such a group can be studied . \n( cf. Rapoport , 1959 : : Ch. 11 . \n) Here I think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent . \n\nAnalysis Analysis means the evaluation of subparts , the comparative ratings of parts , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements . \nAnalysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts . \nImpersonal purposes Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals . \nRoleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals . \nFor example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying . \nExamples Let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis . \n"}

Washington -- Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan. 20 . \n\nthe honeybee , practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor . \nOccasionally , you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning over sods in your garden , but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all . \nThey keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt . \nI must add at once that these animals are what we call  queens  , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn . \nIt is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold weather . \nEven some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease . \nThe survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50-degrees and there is not too much wind . \n\nthe three main categories of antisubmarine warfare operations are defense of shipping , defense of naval forces , and area defense . \nThe last category overlaps the others in amphibious operations and near terminals and bases . \nTo effect these operations , five elements exist ( 1 ) surface , ( 2 ) air , ( 3 ) mines , ( 4 ) submarine , and ( 5 ) fixed installations . \nSurface forces have been used to provide defense zones around naval and merchant ship formations , air to furnish area surveillance , and mines for protection of limited areas . \nSubmarines and shore installations are new elements . \nThe submarine now has a definite place in submarine defense particularly in denying enemy access to ocean areas . \n\nSome of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . \nFirst , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . \nIn contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls . \nThe Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . \nSecond , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . \nAlthough the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . \nThird , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children . \nThe Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children . \n\nSentiment . \nTension management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling . \nOne of the devices for tension management is preferential mating . \nThe preferential mating of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study . \nThe relative geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating . \nIt would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society . \nThe supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation . \nThe newlyweds building homes on the same land with either set of parents , and the almost exclusive use of members of the population as sponsors for baptisms and weddings illustrate this supportive relationship . \n\nMany other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length . \nLaurence M.

Barker , who developed the classification-angle system , was about to begin the systematic compilation of the index when he died in 1931 . \nThe compilation work was undertaken by a number of interested crystallographers in the Department of Mineralogy of the University Museum at Oxford . \nSince 1948 the working headquarters has been the Department of Geology and Mineralogy . \nNumerous cooperating individuals in Great Britain , Holland , the United States , and Belgium have contributed editorially or by making calculations . \nGreat interest and practical help have been given by the Barker Index Committee . \nFinancial and material help have come from academic , governmental , and industrial organizations in England and Holland . \nEditors for Volumes 1 , and 2 , were M.W.

Miller's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . \nIn his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . \nThis essay seeks to make that exploration . \nDickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . \nHe knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response . \n\nthe honeybee , practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor . \nOccasionally , you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning over sods in your garden , but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all . \nThey keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt . \nI must add at once that these animals are what we call  queens  , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn . \nIt is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold weather . \nEven some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease . \nThe survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50-degrees and there is not too much wind . \n\nA cookie with caramel filling and chocolate frosting won $ 25,000 for a Minneapolis housewife in the 13th annual Pillsbury Bake-Off Tuesday . \nMrs. Alice H.

? \nWhat to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ? \nMost library budgets are hopelessly inadequate . \nA startlingly high percentage do not exceed $ 500 annually , which includes the librarian's salary , and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world's richest city . \n\nGreer Garson , world-famous star of stage , screen and television , will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has created a high standard in her profession . \nAs a Neiman-Marcus award winner the titian-haired Miss Garson is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion this season . \nShe will receive the 1961  Oscar  at the 24th annual Neiman-Marcus Exposition , Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel . \nThe only woman recipient , Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando Sarmi , creator of chic , beautiful women's fashions ; ; Harry Rolnick , president of the Byer-Rolnick Hat Corporation and designer of men's hats ; ; Sydney Wragge , creator of sophisticated casuals for women and Roger Vivier , designer of Christian Dior shoes Paris , France , whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized the shoe industry . \nThe silver and ebony plaques will be presented at noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus , president of Neiman-Marcus , Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas Society for Crippled Children Cerebral Palsy Treatment Center . \nThe attractive Greer Garson , who loves beautiful clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles , prefers timeless classical designs . \n\nsentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . \nThe tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . \nThere is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes . \nThus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley's hymns are as follows . \n A charge to keep I have , A God to glorify  . \nIn the tune to which this hymn is most often sung ,  Boylston  , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have . \nDominant stress is of course more than extended duration , and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center on its first syllable rather than its last . \nBut the parallel is significant . \n\nThe set of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy . \nAn optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product . \nThere are thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The specification of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired . \nFor a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream . \nFor the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter . \nThe objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ; ; it is the subject of Chapter 4 . \n\nMany other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length . \nLaurence M.

Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week . \nHigh up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte . \nOn this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . \nIdeally , the President would like the French to agree on a  status quo ante  on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . \nTo continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . \nThe President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support . \n"}

Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4 . \n\nMiami , Fla. , March 17 -- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . \nIndications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage . \nSiebern hits homer Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . \nThen Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock . \nA two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . \nHouse throws wild With one down in the eighth , Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle . \n\nSome of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . \nFirst , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . \nIn contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls . \nThe Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . \nSecond , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . \nAlthough the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . \nThird , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children . \nThe Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children . \n\nreasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . \nAnd this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . \nOne such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . \nHere , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . \nTwo major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . \nThe double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define  relative costs  , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . \nFor more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses . \nBy all means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs , and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution . \n\nA Night in New Orleans  is the gayety planned by members of the Thrift Shop Committee for May 6 at Philmont Country Club . \nThe women have a reputation for giving parties that are different and are fun and this year's promises to follow in this fine tradition . \nMrs. H.J. Grinsfelder is chairman . \nThe Louisiana city is known , of course , for its fine food , good music and its colorful hospitality  and , when guests arrive at Philmont that night  , says Mrs. Grinsfelder ,  that is exactly what we expect to offer them . \nWe 've been working for weeks . \nThe prospects look great . \nWe are keeping a number of surprises under our hats . \n\nThe bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout . \nThe pulmonary vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type 1 , , follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( figs. 8 , 22 ) . \nAnother marked difference is noted here . \nThe pulmonary artery , in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveoli , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura ( fig. 8 ) . \nThe bronchial artery , except for a small number of short branches in the hilum , contributes none of the pleural blood supply . \nIt does , as in type 1 , , supply the hilar lymph nodes , the pulmonary artery , the pulmonary vein , the bronchi , and the bronchioles -- terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole . \nNo bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were noted in this group . \n\nA . \nReasons for selecting mail questionnaire method There were two methods that could have been used for conducting the study within the resources available : ( 1 ) interviews in depth with a few selected companies , and ( 2 ) the more limited interrogation of a large number of companies by means of a mail questionnaire . \nWhile the method of interviewing a small number of companies was appealing because of the opportunity it might have furnished to probe fully the reasons and circumstances of a company's practices and opinions , it also involved the risk of paying undue attention to the unique and peculiar problems of just a few individual companies . \nAs a result , it was decided that a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more effective in determining the general practices and opinions of small firms and in highlighting some of the fundamental and recurring problems of defense procurement that concern both industry and government . \nIt was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest fruitful inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more detailed nature . \nIt is recognized that a mail questionnaire has inherent limitations . \n\ninvisible , modern revolt , like X-rays and radioactivity , is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels , where it is called delinquency . \n Disaffiliation  , by the way , is the term used by the critic and poet , Lawrence Lipton , who has written several articles on this subject , the first of which , in The Nation , quoted as Epigraph :  We disaffiliate . \n -- John L. Lewis . \nLike the pillars of Hercules , like two ruined Titans guarding the entrance to one of Dante's circles , stand two great dead juvenile delinquents -- the heroes of the post-war generation : the great saxophonist , Charlie Parker , and Dylan Thomas . \nIf the word deliberate means anything , both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves . \nBoth of them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves , because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical art . \n\nIt is not easy for the therapist to discern when , in the patient's communicating , an introject has appeared and is holding sway . \nOne learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone -- to his voice's suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , parrot-like . \nThe content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition , as if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove ; ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over and over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him . \nOne hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo-emotion , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her . \nEventually such incidents became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior -- which , as usual , went on without any accompanying words from her -- she asked , eagerly ,  Did you see Granny  ? ? \nAt first I did not know what she meant ; ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother , in their distant home-city . \nThen I realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; ; and when I replied in this spirit , she corroborated my hunch . \nAt another phase in the therapy , when a pathogenic mother-introject began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene , she muttered in a low but intense voice , to herself ,  I hate that woman inside me  ! ! \n\nUnemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . \nSome vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . \nCurrent programs The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home economics . \nSince 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . \nThe George-Barden Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith Act . \nThe Health Amendment Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical nurse training . \nThe latest major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden Act . \n"}

Monroe Jr. , will give her in marriage . \nIn the small group will be the junior and senior Mrs. Walter Monroe ; ; the bridegroom's parents , the Barrett Wendells , who are returning from a winter holiday in Sarasota , Fla. , for the occasion ; ; and his brother , Mr. Wendell Jr. , and his wife , who will arrive from Boston . \nMr. Wendell Jr. will be best man . \nAlso present will be the bride's children , Joan , 13 , and Kirkland , 11 . \nTheir father is Charles B. Armour . \nThe bridegroom's children were here for the Christmas holidays and ca n't return . \n\nSeveral defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday . \nThe disclosure by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial . \nBellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan Clements , 30 , a separate trial . \nBellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom . \nFears prejudicial aspects  The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client  , Bellows told the court . \n Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property . \nIt is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others  . \nJudge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired ,  You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this  ? ? \n\n6.4 . \nThe primary decomposition theorem We are trying to study a linear operator T on the finite-dimensional space V , by decomposing T into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense elementary . \nWe can do this through the characteristic values and vectors of T in certain special cases , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial for T factors over the scalar field F into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1 . \nWhat can we do with the general T ? ? \nIf we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems . \nFirst , T may not have a single characteristic value ; ; this is really a deficiency in the scalar field , namely , that it is not algebraically closed . \n\nIt is not easy for the therapist to discern when , in the patient's communicating , an introject has appeared and is holding sway . \nOne learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone -- to his voice's suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , parrot-like . \nThe content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition , as if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove ; ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over and over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him . \nOne hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo-emotion , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her . \nEventually such incidents became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior -- which , as usual , went on without any accompanying words from her -- she asked , eagerly ,  Did you see Granny  ? ? \nAt first I did not know what she meant ; ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother , in their distant home-city . \nThen I realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; ; and when I replied in this spirit , she corroborated my hunch . \nAt another phase in the therapy , when a pathogenic mother-introject began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene , she muttered in a low but intense voice , to herself ,  I hate that woman inside me  ! ! \n\nindividual classes of foods differ in their requirements for preservation , a number of methods have been developed over the years involving one or a combination of procedures such as dehydration , fermentation , salting , chemical treatment , canning , refrigeration , and freezing . \nThe basic objectives in each instance are to make available supplies of food during the intervals between harvesting or slaughter , to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and insects , and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of harvest or production to areas of consumption . \nIn earlier years , the preservation of food was essentially related to survival . \nIn the more sophisticated atmosphere of today's developed nations , food-preservation techniques have } sought also to bring variety , peak freshness , and optimum taste and flavor in foods at reasonable cost to the consumer . \nWith the development of nuclear technology , isotopic materials , and machine radiation sources in recent years , the possibilities of applying ionizing radiation to the preservation of foods attracted the attention of investigators in the United States and throughout the world . \nAn early hope that irradiation might be the ultimate answer to practically all food preservation problems was soon dispelled . \nInterest remained , however , in the possibility that it would serve as a useful supplementary method for counteracting spoilage losses and for preserving some foods at lower over-all costs than freezing , or without employing heat or chemicals with their attendant taste alterations . \nFactors responsible for the spoilage of foods The chief factors responsible for the spoilage of fresh foodstuffs are ( 1 ) microorganisms such as bacteria , molds , and yeasts , ( 2 ) enzymes , ( 3 ) insects , ( 4 ) sprouting , and ( 5 ) chemical reactions . \n\nPolyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited . \nThe market today for detergent builders is quite diverse . \nThe best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . \nThese widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50 % by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate . \nIn the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; ; and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised . \nA well-publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder ratio . \nHard-surface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products : ( 1 ) the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork . \n\nA variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies . \nThese include low-temperature ethanol ( Cohn ) fractionation , electrophoresis , ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses . \nModifications of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators . \nAbelson and Rawson , using a stepwise elution scheme , fractionated whole sera containing ABO and Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose . \nSpeer and coworkers , in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera , used a series of gradients for elution from Afj . \nFahey and Morrison used a single , continuous gradient at constant pH for the fractionation of anti-A and anti-B agglutinins from preisolated \\*\\* yg-globulin samples . \nIn the present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose using single gradients similar to those described by Sober and Peterson , and certain chemical and serological properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the ABO and Rh systems have been described . \nMaterials and methods samples . \n\nEnrique Jorda , conductor and musical director of the San Francisco Symphony , will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in Europe before returning home to open the symphony's Golden Anniversary season , it was announced . \nThe guest assignments are scheduled for November 14 and 18 , with the Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana in Palermo and the Orchestra of Radio Cologne . \nThe season in San Francisco will open with a special Gala Concert on November 22 . \nDuring his five-month visit abroad , Jorda recently conducted the Orchestre Philharmonique De Bordeau in France , and the Santa Cecilia Orchestra in Rome . \nIn announcing Jorda's return , the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th anniversary season will start at the Sherman Clay box office on Wednesday . \nGuest performers and conductors during the coming season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing with the orchestra , including violinists Yehudi Menuhin , Isaac Stern , Ruggiero Ricci and David Abel ; ; pianists Leon Fleisher , Ruth Slenczynka and Stephen Bishop and conductor Earl Bernard Murray . \nThe Leningrad Kirov Ballet , which opened a series of performances Friday night at the Opera House , is , I think , the finest  classical  ballet company I have ever seen , and the production of the Petipa-Tschaikowsky  Sleeping Beauty  with which it began the series is incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing . \n"}

Price Daniel's  abandoned property  act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . \nDaniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . \nUnder committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . \nBut questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . \nDaniel termed  extremely conservative  his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 . \nHe told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books  since Texas was a republic  . \nIt permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more . \nThe bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer . \n\nThe Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced  no evidence  that any irregularities took place . \nThe jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election ,  deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta  for the manner in which the election was conducted . \nThe September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible  irregularities  in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr ..  Only a relative handful of such reports was received  , the jury said ,  considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city  . \nThe jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws  are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous  . \nIt recommended that Fulton legislators act  to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them  . \nThe grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said  are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments  . \nMerger proposed However , the jury said it believes  these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration  . \n\ninvisible , modern revolt , like X-rays and radioactivity , is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels , where it is called delinquency . \n Disaffiliation  , by the way , is the term used by the critic and poet , Lawrence Lipton , who has written several articles on this subject , the first of which , in The Nation , quoted as Epigraph :  We disaffiliate . \n -- John L.

Oliver for her Hawaiian coffee ring , a rich yeast bread with coconut filling and vanilla glaze . \nMother of five Mrs. Oliver is mother of five children and wife of a machinist . \nShe lives in Wellsville , Mo .. Mrs. Reese baked her cookies for only the third time in the Bake-off finals . \nAnd the third time was the charm . \nShe dreamed up the cookie recipe , tried it , liked it and entered it in the contest . \n\nLondon , Feb. 9 -- Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine , the Dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire United States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today . \nThe Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year . \nIt is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs . \nIt has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy's Nautilus , the world's first atomic submarine . \nIts power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack . \nFive held for trial The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow St. police court here at the end of a three day hearing . \nA full trial was ordered for : Two British civil servants , Miss Ethel Gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , Harry Houghton , 55 , and divorced . \n\nEmory University's Board of Trustees announced Friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state's tax laws made such a step possible . \n Emory University's charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race  , board chairman Henry L. Bowden stated . \nBut an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes . \nThe statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated . \n Emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions  , the statement said . \nThe statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation . \nAn Emory spokesman indicated , however , that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws . \n\none characteristic distinguishes Boris Godunov , it is the consistency with which every person on the stage -- including the chorus -- comes alive in the music . \nMuch of this lifelike quality results from Mussorgsky's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections . \nIn this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera ; ; such composers as Monteverdi , Lully and Purcell , with the same goal in mind , had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages . \nThrough long experimentation in his songs , Mussorgsky developed a Russian recitative as different from others as the language itself . \nGiving most of his musical continuity to the orchestra , he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence , but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words . \nThe moments of sung melody , in the usual sense , come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing , as in folk songs and liturgical chants . \n\nMr. Justice Black was one of the minority that rested on the Article 1 , power . \nIn this view , supported by only three members of the Court , a power denied by the specific provisions of Article 3 , was granted by the generality of Article 1 . \nIf this seems arbitrary , its effect was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally with citizens of the states -- at the expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction . \nFederal question jurisdiction For almost a hundred years we relied upon state courts ( subject to review by the Supreme Court ) for the protection of most rights arising under national law . \nThen in 1875 , apparently in response to the nationalizing influence of the Civil War , Congress first gave the lower federal courts general authority -- concurrently with state tribunals -- to decide cases involving federal-right questions . \nOne purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the Civil War amendments against state interference . \n\nreasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . \nAnd this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . \nOne such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . \nHere , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . \nTwo major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . \nThe double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define  relative costs  , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . \nFor more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses . \n\nHotel Escape's Bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction , the versatile  Kings 4 , Plus Two  . \nThis is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while -- a well integrated , fast moving outfit specializing in skits , vocals , comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch . \nShow spotlights the Kings -- George Worth , Bill Kay , Frank Ciciulla and Gene Wilson , flanked by Dave Grossman and Ron Stevens . \nThe Plus Two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine , and the beat is solid . \nIn the comedy division , the Kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props . \nNet result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense , part of which can be classed as pure slapstick . \n"}

Clinton Bowman , who celebrates her birthday on Tuesday . \n\nAsilomar , March 26 Vast spraying programs conducted by  technicians with narrow training and little wisdom  are endangering crops and wildlife , Carl W. Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . \n It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play  , he commented . \nBuchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . \n But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop  , he said . \nThe conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . \nThere have even been serious errors in the U.S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . \n The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries  , Buchheister told the delegates . \n\nthe hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week . \nFor many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous . \nIt was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ; ; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell . \nInvestors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many . \nIn fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares . \nSome Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers . \n\nAnglo-Saxon and Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age . \nHrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at Finnsburg ( lines 1068 - 1159 ) , and improvises the tale of Beowulf's exploits in a complimentary comparison of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund ( lines 871 - 892 ) ; ; Alcinous ' court bard sings of the discovered adultery of Ares and Aphrodite ( Odyssey 8 266-366 ) , and takes up a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens on ( Odyssey 8 499-520 ) . \nNothing in all this is autobiographical : unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith , the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ; the poet of The Odyssey , reputed blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel Demodocus . \nSince none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter , there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition . \nThat such a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey , at least , is hard to deny . \nMilman Parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant Homeric poems are largely formulaic , and was led to postulate that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of Greek epic survived ; ; he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition , and assumed the slightly less likely corollary that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas . \nProceeding from Parry's conclusions and adopting one of his schemata , Francis P. Magoun , Jr. , argues that Beowulf likewise was created from a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive generations , and the thesis is striking and compelling . \n\nPurification of the conjugates In attempting to improve specificity of staining , the fluorescein-labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways : ( 1 ) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders ( Coons , 1958 ) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( E.F. Smith & Townsend ) on sweet clover stems . \n( 2 ) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 - 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems . \nThe proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of Afj in Afj to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80 % saturation with Afj . \nThe precipitate was washed twice with an 80 % saturated solution of Afj , dissolved in a small quantity of 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer , dialyzed against cold distilled water till free from ammonium ions , and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen . \n( 3 ) In other experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade ( 1957 ) . \n( 4 ) The conjugates were passed through a diethylaminoethyl ( DEAE ) cellulose column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer ( PBS ) containing Afj potassium phosphate and Afj . \nPreparation of frozen sections The technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that described by Coons et al ( 1951 ) . \nRoot and stem tumors from sweet clover plants infected with WTV were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen , embedded in ice , and cut at 3 - 6 \\*\\* ym in a cryostat maintained at -16-degrees to -20-degrees . \n\nThe preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined by the sociologist . \nLike primitive numbers in mathematics , the entire axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth . \nBut what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduces the idea of physical models ? ? \nIs it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred canons in social science ? ? \nIt has become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by erecting mathematical and physical models , is itself a conditioned response to a world which pays a premium price for technological manipulation . \nThis push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word  mass  to mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals in such a group can be studied . \n( cf. Rapoport , 1959 : : Ch. 11 . \n) Here I think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent . \n\nIntroduction Muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though serious complication of steroid therapy , with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use . \nAlthough biopsies have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid-induced weakness , this case provides the only example known to us in which necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups . \nThe case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of steroids for a refractory anemia . \nReport of case This patient was a 65-year-old white male accountant who entered the New York Hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26 , 1959 , because of disabling weakness and general debility . \nIn 1953 the patient developed an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood transfusions were given over a period of 4 years . \nSplenomegaly was first noted in 1956 , and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time showed  scattered foci of fibrosis  suggestive of myelofibrosis . \nNo additional transfusions were necessary after the institution of prednisone in July , 1957 , in an initial dose of 40 mg. daily with gradual tapering to 10 mg. daily . \nThis medication was continued until February , 1958 . \n\none characteristic distinguishes Boris Godunov , it is the consistency with which every person on the stage -- including the chorus -- comes alive in the music . \nMuch of this lifelike quality results from Mussorgsky's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections . \nIn this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera ; ; such composers as Monteverdi , Lully and Purcell , with the same goal in mind , had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages . \nThrough long experimentation in his songs , Mussorgsky developed a Russian recitative as different from others as the language itself . \nGiving most of his musical continuity to the orchestra , he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence , but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words . \nThe moments of sung melody , in the usual sense , come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing , as in folk songs and liturgical chants . \nOtherwise Mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies for prolonged expressions of emotion -- Boris ' first monologue , for example . \nEven then , the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that the word comes first in importance . \n"}

Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . \nIdeally , the President would like the French to agree on a  status quo ante  on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . \nTo continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . \nThe President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support . \n\nMiami , Fla. , March 17 -- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . \nIndications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage . \nSiebern hits homer Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . \nThen Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock . \nA two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . \nHouse throws wild With one down in the eighth , Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle . \n\nthe effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) . \nB. Organification of iodine The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood . \nHowever , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . \nIn the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ; De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) . \nThis iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems . \nIn addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . \nIf tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) . \n\nitself in the sands of the 19th Century , the grand stream of Italian Renaissance architectural decoration made a last appearance in the Brumidi frescos of the Capitol Rotunda in Washington . \nThe artistic generation after Brumidi was trained in the Paris of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution , and tended to overlook greatness of conception where faults and weakness were easy to find . \nBut it is a great conception . \nThe open ceiling , with allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky : the closed frieze , formally divided into historical scenes and tightly tied to the stone walls , belong in their large ordering to the line of Correggio and his Baroque followers . \nThe descent may be remote , but this is surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance in the United States . \nConstantino Brumidi designed the decorative scheme as a whole , in collaboration with the architect Charles U. Walter , at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of Bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure . \nAfter many years and many interruptions he was able to finish the canopy fresco , and slightly less than half the frieze , beginning with the Liberty group opposite the East door , and ending with William Penn , all but one leg , when a tragic accident ended his career . \nHe left at his death sketches , drawn to scale , for the rest of the circle . \n\nThere are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory . \nMollusks are a case in point . \nThe shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . \nThough this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . \nThere can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . \nThe deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . \nBy way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence . \n\nThe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.M. next Saturday . \nThe current monthly payroll comes to about $ 15,000,000 . \nHoward E. Simpson , the railroad's president , said ,  A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action  . \nThe reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates . \nSalary cut and lay-offs It will be accomplished in two ways : 1 A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions . \nThere are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class . \n\nThe Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves . \nGary Player , the small , trim South African , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap . \nArnold Palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief . \n Just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you  , Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament . \nAnd that is just what happened on the last few holes . \nThe Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer . \n"}

; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . \nIn societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . \nWith the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . \nNevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . \nAlthough the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . \nIf the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . \n\nit is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief  structuring  experience . \nIt was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal , concretistic reports of what the ambiguous figure  looked like  as reflecting their hesitancy about taking chances . \nThis was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action . \nResponses such as  rope with a loop in it  , and  two pieces of rope  , were quite characteristic . \nGuilford-Martin personality inventories . \nThe three personality inventories ( Guilford ;

; Wyatt and Whipple , 1950 ) , which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging solar radiation , causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth . \nThe radial velocity varies inversely as the particle size -- a 1000-m-diameter particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years . \nWhipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag . \nFurther , the corpuscular radiation , i.e. , the solar-wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force . \nThe Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi-major axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun . \nAlso , planetary gravitational attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached . \n"}

Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is  Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism  . \nMitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr . \nR-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel . \nThe controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club . \nIt was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs . \nHughes said Monday ,  It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired . \n\nthe Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration of Independence . \nDuring the Brown trial , however , the state's most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence Daily Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associates , with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists , had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal governments . \nThe Providence Daily Journal answered the Daily Post by stating that the raid of John Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that  He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican Party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states  . \nThe two major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history . \nWhile the Daily Post continued to accuse Republicans and the Daily Journal continued to accuse Democrats , the Woonsocket Patriot complained that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn Brown and his men . \nEditor Foss stated ,  Of their guilt there can be no doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial  . \nThe Providence Daily Post thought that there were probably good reasons for the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be calmer feelings . \n\nThe bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout . \nThe pulmonary vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type 1 , , follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( figs. 8 , 22 ) . \nAnother marked difference is noted here . \nThe pulmonary artery , in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveoli , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura ( fig. 8 ) . \nThe bronchial artery , except for a small number of short branches in the hilum , contributes none of the pleural blood supply . \nIt does , as in type 1 , , supply the hilar lymph nodes , the pulmonary artery , the pulmonary vein , the bronchi , and the bronchioles -- terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole . \n\nAsilomar , March 26 Vast spraying programs conducted by  technicians with narrow training and little wisdom  are endangering crops and wildlife , Carl W. Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . \n It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play  , he commented . \nBuchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . \n But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop  , he said . \nThe conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . \nThere have even been serious errors in the U.S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . \n\nControl of socioeconomic status It would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being investigated : the degree of structure in teaching method . \nThe structured schools were in an industrial city , with three-family tenement houses typical of the residential areas , but with one rather sizable section of middle-class homes . \nThe unstructured schools were in a large suburban community , predominantly middle - to upper-middle class , but fringed by an industrial area . \nIn order to equate the samples on socioeconomic status , we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods . \nSchool principals and guidance workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas . \nAn objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data . \nEqual proportions of children in each city were drawn from upper-lower and lower-middle class neighborhoods . \n\ncrucial encounter One of the initial questions put to President Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev . \nMr. Kennedy replied :  I 'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground  . \nThe President knew that a confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable . \nBut he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting . \nHe wanted to buy time to strengthen the U.S. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy . \nLast Friday the White House announced : President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4 . \nThe announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East-West relations . \nThe heightened tension , in fact , had been a major factor in the President's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet leader . \n\nSeveral defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday . \nThe disclosure by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial . \nBellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan Clements , 30 , a separate trial . \nBellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom . \nFears prejudicial aspects  The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client  , Bellows told the court . \n Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property . \n"}

cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) . \nThus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . \nIt was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy . \nA detailed energy balance of the anode was established . \nThe anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount . \nThe dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Afj . \nQualitative observations were made and high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities . \n\nMickey Charles Mantle , the New York Yankees ' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime . \nWhen Roger Eugene Maris , Mantle's muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe . \nBut when tiny , 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained ,  the other team thought no one was out there  , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous . \nThis is Baseball 1961 . \nThis is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous . \nIt is the year when ( 1 ) amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and , in unprecedented style , delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs ; ; ( 2 ) Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game ; ; ( 3 ) the Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them ; ; and ( 4 ) catcher Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter . \n\none explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium ( section 381 ( c ) ( 9 ) ) , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section 381 ( c ) ( 16 ) ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section 381 ( c ) ( 6 ) ) , but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company ( section 381 ( c ) ( 14 ) ) , but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes ? ? \nThese items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . \nThere does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities . \nWith respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 ( c ) , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation . \nTo this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute . \nIt is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes . \nSuch an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone ; ; it would certainly violate the intention of Congress as expressed in the Committee Report ; ; and in at least one instance , involving refund claims , it might be contrary to another provision of the United States Code . \n\nSentiment . \nTension management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling . \nOne of the devices for tension management is preferential mating . \nThe preferential mating of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study . \nThe relative geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating . \nIt would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society . \n\nIntroduction Muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though serious complication of steroid therapy , with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use . \nAlthough biopsies have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid-induced weakness , this case provides the only example known to us in which necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups . \nThe case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of steroids for a refractory anemia . \nReport of case This patient was a 65-year-old white male accountant who entered the New York Hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26 , 1959 , because of disabling weakness and general debility . \nIn 1953 the patient developed an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood transfusions were given over a period of 4 years . \nSplenomegaly was first noted in 1956 , and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time showed  scattered foci of fibrosis  suggestive of myelofibrosis . \nNo additional transfusions were necessary after the institution of prednisone in July , 1957 , in an initial dose of 40 mg. daily with gradual tapering to 10 mg. daily . \n\nMr. Justice Black was one of the minority that rested on the Article 1 , power . \nIn this view , supported by only three members of the Court , a power denied by the specific provisions of Article 3 , was granted by the generality of Article 1 . \nIf this seems arbitrary , its effect was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally with citizens of the states -- at the expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction . \nFederal question jurisdiction For almost a hundred years we relied upon state courts ( subject to review by the Supreme Court ) for the protection of most rights arising under national law . \nThen in 1875 , apparently in response to the nationalizing influence of the Civil War , Congress first gave the lower federal courts general authority -- concurrently with state tribunals -- to decide cases involving federal-right questions . \nOne purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the Civil War amendments against state interference . \nSerious difficulty arose with the advent of Substantive Due Process . \nAn amendment , presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly freed slaves , became a  laissez-faire  limitation upon state economic policy . \n\nthe outlook for interest rates in 1961 , the question , as always , is the prospect for general business activity . \nBy and large , what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates . \nMoreover , the trend of general business activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal , monetary , and other Federal policies which affect interest rates . \nNineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business activity . \nDuring much of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a record-high plateau , but there have been persistent signs of slack in the economy . \nThe tendency for general business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident . \nAlthough the pause in the advance of general business activity this year has thus far been quite modest , it is hard to escape the conclusion that the softening process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 and possibly somewhat longer . \nIt is difficult to see any powerful sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the economy a new upward thrust . \n\nThe Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced  no evidence  that any irregularities took place . \nThe jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election ,  deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta  for the manner in which the election was conducted . \nThe September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible  irregularities  in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr ..  Only a relative handful of such reports was received  , the jury said ,  considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city  . \nThe jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws  are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous  . \nIt recommended that Fulton legislators act  to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them  . \nThe grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said  are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments  . \nMerger proposed However , the jury said it believes  these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration  . \n\nThe set of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy . \nAn optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product . \nThere are thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The specification of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired . \nFor a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream . \nFor the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter . \nThe objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ; ; it is the subject of Chapter 4 . \n\nitself in the sands of the 19th Century , the grand stream of Italian Renaissance architectural decoration made a last appearance in the Brumidi frescos of the Capitol Rotunda in Washington . \nThe artistic generation after Brumidi was trained in the Paris of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution , and tended to overlook greatness of conception where faults and weakness were easy to find . \nBut it is a great conception . \nThe open ceiling , with allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky : the closed frieze , formally divided into historical scenes and tightly tied to the stone walls , belong in their large ordering to the line of Correggio and his Baroque followers . \nThe descent may be remote , but this is surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance in the United States . \nConstantino Brumidi designed the decorative scheme as a whole , in collaboration with the architect Charles U. Walter , at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of Bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure . \nAfter many years and many interruptions he was able to finish the canopy fresco , and slightly less than half the frieze , beginning with the Liberty group opposite the East door , and ending with William Penn , all but one leg , when a tragic accident ended his career . \n"}

Rapoport , 1959 : : Ch. 11 . \n\n1 . \nIntroduction It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres . \nThe results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . \nWhen sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . \nObservations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface . \nRadio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets . \nThe observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600-degrees . \nThis result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence . \n\nThe nation the three-front war At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad . \nAfterward , Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen . \nWhat Herter presented , said Gore , was  not a very encouraging review  . \nThat was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts . \nWhile Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . \n1 ) Cuba . \n\nThe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.M. next Saturday . \nThe current monthly payroll comes to about $ 15,000,000 . \nHoward E. Simpson , the railroad's president , said ,  A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action  . \nThe reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates . \nSalary cut and lay-offs It will be accomplished in two ways : 1 A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions . \nThere are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class . \n2 Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense . \nSince the railroad can not reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a B. & O. spokesman said . \n\nthe Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration of Independence . \nDuring the Brown trial , however , the state's most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence Daily Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associates , with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists , had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal governments . \nThe Providence Daily Journal answered the Daily Post by stating that the raid of John Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that  He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican Party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states  . \nThe two major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history . \nWhile the Daily Post continued to accuse Republicans and the Daily Journal continued to accuse Democrats , the Woonsocket Patriot complained that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn Brown and his men . \nEditor Foss stated ,  Of their guilt there can be no doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial  . \nThe Providence Daily Post thought that there were probably good reasons for the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be calmer feelings . \n\nThe next question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational policy-makers . \nOn the whole , it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way . \nSeldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn . \nA hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for working-class youth . \nIn situations of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education . \nCampbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve western cities over the period of 1931 - 40 and found  little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence  , as judged by a panel of professional educators who studied the voting records on educational issues . \nThe few cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers , and such issues are not issues of educational policy . \n"}

Organification of iodine The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood . \nHowever , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . \nIn the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ; De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) . \nThis iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems . \nIn addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . \nIf tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) . \nIt is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue . \n\nIt is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels . \nNo single explanation is adequate to account for this . \nImprovement , however , is urgent , and at least three things will be needed . \nThe first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses . \nEven beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant systems , both in their general outlines and in many specific details . \nAn advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems , including some of the more unusual types . \nBy contrast , even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the over-simple distinction between register and contour languages . \nThis limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone . \n\ncrucial encounter One of the initial questions put to President Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev . \nMr. Kennedy replied :  I 'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground  . \nThe President knew that a confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable . \nBut he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting . \nHe wanted to buy time to strengthen the U.S. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy . \nLast Friday the White House announced : President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4 . \nThe announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East-West relations . \nThe heightened tension , in fact , had been a major factor in the President's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet leader . \n\nAbstract Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) . \nThus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . \nIt was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy . \nA detailed energy balance of the anode was established . \nThe anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount . \nThe dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Afj . \nQualitative observations were made and high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities . \n\nA royal decree issued in 1910 , two years after the Belgian government assumed authority for the administration of the Congo , prescribed the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms . \nFurther decrees along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919 . \nIn 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the Governor-General , and the periodic compilation of these records was ordered . \nBut specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors . \nA unified set of regulations , applicable to all areas , was issued in 1929 , and a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was instituted at the same time . \nThe whole system was again reviewed and reorganized in 1933 . \nGeneral responsibility for its administration rested with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs , Service des Affaires Indigenes et de la Main-d'Oeuvre ( AIMO , Afj Direction , Afj Direction Generale , Gouvernement Generale ) . \nTribal authorities , the chiefs and their secretaries , were held responsible for maintaining the registers of indigenous persons within their territories , under the general supervision of district officials . \n\nthe Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration of Independence . \nDuring the Brown trial , however , the state's most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence Daily Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associates , with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists , had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal governments . \nThe Providence Daily Journal answered the Daily Post by stating that the raid of John Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that  He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican Party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states  . \nThe two major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history . \nWhile the Daily Post continued to accuse Republicans and the Daily Journal continued to accuse Democrats , the Woonsocket Patriot complained that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn Brown and his men . \nEditor Foss stated ,  Of their guilt there can be no doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial  . \n\n1 . \nIntroduction It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres . \nThe results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . \nWhen sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . \nObservations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface . \nRadio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets . \n\nThe Sane Society is an ambitious work . \nIts scope is as broad as the question : What does it mean to live in modern society ?

John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws . \nOnce more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally . \nOr , in the words of Anatole France ,  The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges  . \nThe public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites . \nThe Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program . \nIn addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill . \nIt is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers ' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike . \n"}

; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . \nIn societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . \nWith the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . \nNevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . \nAlthough the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . \nIf the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . \n\nAn analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts . \nFirst is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion . \nPreparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes . \nAll political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination . \nThe second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting . \nConsiderable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach . \n\nOslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . \nThis has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . \nIn Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems . \nThis atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the  colonialist  powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . \nThe nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . \nExplosion avoided In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . \nThe general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council . \nThere should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members ' votes , since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance . \n\nthe outlook for interest rates in 1961 , the question , as always , is the prospect for general business activity . \nBy and large , what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates . \nMoreover , the trend of general business activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal , monetary , and other Federal policies which affect interest rates . \nNineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business activity . \nDuring much of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a record-high plateau , but there have been persistent signs of slack in the economy . \nThe tendency for general business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident . \nAlthough the pause in the advance of general business activity this year has thus far been quite modest , it is hard to escape the conclusion that the softening process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 and possibly somewhat longer . \n\n70 North Providence taxpayers made appeals to the board of tax assessors for a review of their 1961 tax assessments during the last two days at the town hall in Centredale . \nThese were the last two days set aside by the board for hearing appeals . \nAppeals were heard for two days two weeks ago . \nAbout 75 persons appeared at that time . \nLouis H. Grenier , clerk of the board , said that the appeals will be reviewed in December at the time the board is visiting new construction sites in the town for assessment purposes . \nThey also will visit properties on which appeals have been made . \nAny adjustments which are made , Mr. Grenier said earlier this month , will appear on the balance of the tax bill since most of the town's taxpayers take the option of paying quarterly with the balance due next year . \nJohn Pezza , 69 , of 734 Hartford Avenue , Providence , complained of shoulder pains after an accident in which a car he was driving collided with a car driven by Antonio Giorgio , 25 , of 12 DeSoto St. , Providence , on Greenville Avenue and Cherry Hill Road in Johnston yesterday . \n\nsentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . \nThe tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . \nThere is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes . \nThus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley's hymns are as follows . \n A charge to keep I have , A God to glorify  . \nIn the tune to which this hymn is most often sung ,  Boylston  , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have . \nDominant stress is of course more than extended duration , and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center on its first syllable rather than its last . \nBut the parallel is significant . \n\nA royal decree issued in 1910 , two years after the Belgian government assumed authority for the administration of the Congo , prescribed the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms . \nFurther decrees along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919 . \nIn 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the Governor-General , and the periodic compilation of these records was ordered . \nBut specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors . \nA unified set of regulations , applicable to all areas , was issued in 1929 , and a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was instituted at the same time . \nThe whole system was again reviewed and reorganized in 1933 . \nGeneral responsibility for its administration rested with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs , Service des Affaires Indigenes et de la Main-d'Oeuvre ( AIMO , Afj Direction , Afj Direction Generale , Gouvernement Generale ) . \nTribal authorities , the chiefs and their secretaries , were held responsible for maintaining the registers of indigenous persons within their territories , under the general supervision of district officials . \n\nThose whom I wish to address with this letter are for the most part unknown to me . \nIt may well be that , when Rudy Pozzatti and I visited your country last spring , you were living and working close to the places we saw and the streets we walked . \nAs American artists , it was natural that we would want to meet as many Soviet artists as possible . \nThis letter might not have been necessary had our efforts to meet and talk with you been more successful . \nEven though we did not see many of your faces , it appears now quite evident that a considerable number of your profession heard , from those whom we had the fortune to encounter , that we had been in your midst . \nI am very pleased that quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to hear of our reactions and experiences in the U.S.S.R . \n\nlast the White House is going to get some much-copied furniture by that master American craftsman , Duncan Phyfe , whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the U.S. Presidents of the 19th Century sent abroad for their furnishings . \nThe American Institute of Decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the Executive Mansion's library . \nThe suite has been in the same family since the early 1800's . \nThe gift is being presented by  heirs and descendants of the Rutherford family of New Jersey , whose famous estate ,  Tranquility  , was located near the Duncan Phyfe workshop at Andover , N.

Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday . \nThe disclosure by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial . \nBellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan Clements , 30 , a separate trial . \nBellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom . \nFears prejudicial aspects  The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client  , Bellows told the court . \n Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property . \nIt is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others  . \n\nit has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms possible . \nThe instrument is shown in Fig. 1 and consists essentially of a hard , sharp , tungsten carbide knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating . \nThe force required to accomplish removal is plotted , by means of an electronic recorder , against distance of removal . \nSince the removal force is a function of coating thickness , a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness . \nThis , too , is recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut . \nA number of adjustment features are included in the Hesiometer to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited on such substrates as iron and other metals , glass , wood , and plastic surfaces . \nThe measurement of topcoats on primers can also readily be carried out . \n\nAustin , Texas -- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's  abandoned property  act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . \nDaniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . \nUnder committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . \nBut questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . \nDaniel termed  extremely conservative  his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 . \nHe told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books  since Texas was a republic  . \nIt permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more . \n\nA . \nReasons for selecting mail questionnaire method There were two methods that could have been used for conducting the study within the resources available : ( 1 ) interviews in depth with a few selected companies , and ( 2 ) the more limited interrogation of a large number of companies by means of a mail questionnaire . \nWhile the method of interviewing a small number of companies was appealing because of the opportunity it might have furnished to probe fully the reasons and circumstances of a company's practices and opinions , it also involved the risk of paying undue attention to the unique and peculiar problems of just a few individual companies . \nAs a result , it was decided that a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more effective in determining the general practices and opinions of small firms and in highlighting some of the fundamental and recurring problems of defense procurement that concern both industry and government . \nIt was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest fruitful inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more detailed nature . \nIt is recognized that a mail questionnaire has inherent limitations . \nThere is the danger that the questions will mean different things to different respondents . \n\nThe set of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy . \nAn optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product . \nThere are thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The specification of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired . \nFor a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream . \nFor the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter . \nThe objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ; ; it is the subject of Chapter 4 . \nThe essential characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages with no feedback was first isolated by Bellman . \nHe recognized that whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an R-stage process , the remaining stages must use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage , if there is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process . \n\nThe nation the three-front war At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad . \nAfterward , Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen . \nWhat Herter presented , said Gore , was  not a very encouraging review  . \nThat was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts . \nWhile Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . \n1 ) Cuba . \nHours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery , Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens , plus 120 Cuban employees ) . \n"}

Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week . \nHigh up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte . \nOn this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . \nIdeally , the President would like the French to agree on a  status quo ante  on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . \nTo continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . \nThe President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support . \n\nThe vast Central Valley of California is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world . \nDuring the summer of 1960 , it became the setting for a bitter and basic labor-management struggle . \nThe contestants in this economic struggle are the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee ( AWOC ) of the AFL-CIO and the agricultural employers of the State . \nBy virtue of the legal responsibilities of the Department of Employment in the farm placement program , we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces . \nIt is not a pleasant or easy position , but one we have endeavored to maintain . \nWe have sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties , but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose . \nInevitably , one side was pleased and the other displeased , regardless of how we ruled . \n\nThere are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts . \nThis may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both . \nThe differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . \n( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . \n) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison . \nThe greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used . \nThese differences in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between illiterate informants and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area , but that Hoijer's vocabulary is based on Swadesh's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined . \nSwadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal ; ; I , one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley . \n\nThe Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves . \nGary Player , the small , trim South African , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap . \nArnold Palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief . \n Just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you  , Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament . \nAnd that is just what happened on the last few holes . \nThe Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer . \n\nThe vast Central Valley of California is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world . \nDuring the summer of 1960 , it became the setting for a bitter and basic labor-management struggle . \nThe contestants in this economic struggle are the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee ( AWOC ) of the AFL-CIO and the agricultural employers of the State . \nBy virtue of the legal responsibilities of the Department of Employment in the farm placement program , we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces . \nIt is not a pleasant or easy position , but one we have endeavored to maintain . \nWe have sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties , but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose . \nInevitably , one side was pleased and the other displeased , regardless of how we ruled . \n\nRomantic news concerns Mrs. Joan Monroe Armour and F.

Sprinkel , economist of Harris Trust & Savings Bank , Chicago , predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn. , California group , conference . \nAnother speaker , William H. Draper , Jr. , former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper , Gaither & Anderson , urged the U.S. to  throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we wo n't be pushed around any more  . \nHe urged support for President Kennedy's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations . \n' not flash in pan ' Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a  temporary flash in the pan  but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern . \n In view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial  he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but  there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960  . \nThesis refuted Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism  is based on very limited and questionable evidence  . \nRather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth  , he said  it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery  . \nDanger cited He cautioned that  the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation  . \n\ntoll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes . \nLong-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward . \nHigher toll rates also are helping boost revenues . \nResult is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative . \nThings are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds . \nTraffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing . \nThat added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates . \n\nthe hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week . \nFor many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous . \nIt was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ; ; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell . \nInvestors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many . \nIn fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares . \nSome Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers . \nA measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began . \nThe stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $ 12.50 a share . \n\nA proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline Afj as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented . \nAfj is paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening . \nThe lines are asymmetric and over the range of field Afj gauss and temperature Afj the asymmetry increases with increasing Afj and decreasing T . \nAn isotropic resonance shift of Afj to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction . \nThe general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment Afj of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized to Afj . \nThe theory predicts a linear dependence of Afj on Afj , where J is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss constant . \nThe experimental second moment Afj conforms to the relation Afj in agreement with theory . \n"}

Rapoport , 1959 : : Ch. 11 . \n) Here I think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent . \n\nRookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis , 5-3 . \nThe husky 6-3 , 205-pound lefthander , was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area . \nIt was Nischwitz ' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies ' winning streak to four straight . \nThey now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American Association pack . \nNischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning . \nHe has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw . \nThe Bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in Sunday's opener , and never lagged . \nDick McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don Rudolph to open the Bear's attack . \n\nA band viscometer is shown in Figure 2 . \nIt consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims . \nThere is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed . \nA tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks . \nIn normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks . \nAfter it has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded . \nBy the use of various weights , data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtained . \nThe instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described . \n\nA philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . \nBut a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . \nThe man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . \nBy force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . \nThis is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . \nIts boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking . \nThe population of the Congo is 13.5 million , divided into at least seven major  culture clusters  and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects . \n\n1 . \nIntroduction It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres . \nThe results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . \nWhen sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . \nObservations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface . \nRadio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets . \nThe observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600-degrees . \nThis result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence . \n\nAsilomar , March 26 Vast spraying programs conducted by  technicians with narrow training and little wisdom  are endangering crops and wildlife , Carl W. Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . \n It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play  , he commented . \nBuchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . \n But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop  , he said . \nThe conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . \nThere have even been serious errors in the U.S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . \n The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries  , Buchheister told the delegates . \nIn addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying , Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness bill , creation of national seashore parks , including Point Reyes ; ; preservation of the wetlands where birds breed ; ; a pesticides co-ordination act ; ; stronger water pollution control programs , and Federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil . \n\nThe vast Central Valley of California is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world . \nDuring the summer of 1960 , it became the setting for a bitter and basic labor-management struggle . \nThe contestants in this economic struggle are the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee ( AWOC ) of the AFL-CIO and the agricultural employers of the State . \nBy virtue of the legal responsibilities of the Department of Employment in the farm placement program , we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces . \nIt is not a pleasant or easy position , but one we have endeavored to maintain . \nWe have sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties , but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose . \nInevitably , one side was pleased and the other displeased , regardless of how we ruled . \nOften the displeased parties interpreted our decision as implying favoritism toward the other . \n\nA gyro-stabilized platform system , using restrained gyros , is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the gyro-platform-servo combination . \nThe restrained gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion , neglecting transient effects , as follows : Afj where U is a torque applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro . \nThe platform angle \\*\\* yf is the angle about which the gyro is controlling . \nThis is normally termed the gyro input axis , 90-degrees away from the gyro output or \\*\\* yj axis . \nThe gyro angular momentum is defined by H . \nThus if the gyro and platform-controller combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the \\*\\* yf axis , the system can be rotated with an angular velocity Afj if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis Afj . \n\nRecent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M.D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel's impact resides in its  allegoric insight and moral metaphor  . \nJ.H. Miller's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . \nIn his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . \nThis essay seeks to make that exploration . \nDickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . \nHe knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response . \n"}

operators which are in some sense elementary . \nWe can do this through the characteristic values and vectors of T in certain special cases , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial for T factors over the scalar field F into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1 . \nWhat can we do with the general T ? ? \nIf we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems . \nFirst , T may not have a single characteristic value ; ; this is really a deficiency in the scalar field , namely , that it is not algebraically closed . \n\nPolyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited . \nThe market today for detergent builders is quite diverse . \nThe best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . \nThese widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50 % by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate . \nIn the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; ; and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised . \nA well-publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder ratio . \nHard-surface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products : ( 1 ) the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork . \nThe better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders . \n\nsentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . \nThe

the time any other syllables have . \n\nthe century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law . \nSeveral factors contributed to this change . \nThe Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow . \nHere in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . \nThus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century . \nInternational law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . \nEssentially this imposed two conditions : First , international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; ; second , it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared . \nIn both respects , international law was Europeanized . \n\nit was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies . \nIt was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies , and with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other . \n5 . \nPoland frontiers . \nWhen the Yalta Conference opened , the American policy of postponing all discussion of Russia's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down . \nStarting in great force late in December , from a line stretching from East Prussia to Budapest , the Red armies had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the Oder , thirty miles from Berlin , and the Upper Danube region was being rapidly overrun , while the Western Allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine . \nThe long delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia's advantage . \nThe West was now glad to propose the 1919 Curzon Line , which was substantially Russia's 1941 border , as the boundary between Russia and Poland . \n\nA variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies . \nThese include low-temperature ethanol ( Cohn ) fractionation , electrophoresis , ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses . \nModifications of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators . \nAbelson and Rawson , using a stepwise elution scheme , fractionated whole sera containing ABO and Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose . \nSpeer and coworkers , in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera , used a series of gradients for elution from Afj . \nFahey and Morrison used a single , continuous gradient at constant pH for the fractionation of anti-A and anti-B agglutinins from preisolated \\*\\* yg-globulin samples . \n\nThe Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves . \nGary Player , the small , trim South African , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap . \nArnold Palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief . \n Just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you  , Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament . \nAnd that is just what happened on the last few holes . \nThe Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer . \nPlayer was the first to feel its teeth . \nAfter playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( Sunday's fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ) , Player's game rapidly fell to pieces . \n\nSalem ( special ) -- For a second month in a row , Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday . \nIt is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . \nWilliam Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $ 58,918 out of its budgeted $ 66,000 in the category , leaving only $ 7,082 for the rest of the month . \nAt the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $ 17,000 . \nBut it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . \nNo request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . \nBoard oks pact The commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , Roy Webster , of Hood River , and Dr. Ennis Keizer , of North Bend , approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past . \nThe contract with Ray Field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $ 8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month . \n\nsentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of

? \nThese items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . \nThere does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities . \nWith respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 ( c ) , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation . \nTo this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute . \nIt is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes . \nSuch an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone ; ; it would certainly violate the intention of Congress as expressed in the Committee Report ; ; and in at least one instance , involving refund claims , it might be contrary to another provision of the United States Code . \n\n2 : : Some of the major functions of religion The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; ; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . \nIn societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . \nWith the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . \nNevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . \nAlthough the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . \nIf the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . \nThere are several closely related inner functions . \n\nThe bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout . \nThe pulmonary vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type 1 , , follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( figs. 8 , 22 ) . \nAnother marked difference is noted here . \nThe pulmonary artery , in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveoli , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura ( fig. 8 ) . \nThe bronchial artery , except for a small number of short branches in the hilum , contributes none of the pleural blood supply . \nIt does , as in type 1 , , supply the hilar lymph nodes , the pulmonary artery , the pulmonary vein , the bronchi , and the bronchioles -- terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole . \nNo bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were noted in this group . \n\nSeveral defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday . \nThe disclosure by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial . \nBellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan Clements , 30 , a separate trial . \nBellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom . \nFears prejudicial aspects  The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client  , Bellows told the court . \n Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property . \nIt is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others  . \nJudge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired ,  You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this  ? ? \n\nOrganization : In this publication measurements of interfacial angles of crystals are used to classify and identify chemical substances . \nT.V. Barker , who developed the classification-angle system , was about to begin the systematic compilation of the index when he died in 1931 . \nThe compilation work was undertaken by a number of interested crystallographers in the Department of Mineralogy of the University Museum at Oxford . \nSince 1948 the working headquarters has been the Department of Geology and Mineralogy . \nNumerous cooperating individuals in Great Britain , Holland , the United States , and Belgium have contributed editorially or by making calculations . \nGreat interest and practical help have been given by the Barker Index Committee . \nFinancial and material help have come from academic , governmental , and industrial organizations in England and Holland . \nEditors for Volumes 1 , and 2 , were M.W. Porter and the late R.C. Spiller , both of Oxford University . \n\nEnrique Jorda , conductor and musical director of the San Francisco Symphony , will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in Europe before returning home to open the symphony's Golden Anniversary season , it was announced . \nThe guest assignments are scheduled for November 14 and 18 , with the Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana in Palermo and the Orchestra of Radio Cologne . \nThe season in San Francisco will open with a special Gala Concert on November 22 . \nDuring his five-month visit abroad , Jorda recently conducted the Orchestre Philharmonique De Bordeau in France , and the Santa Cecilia Orchestra in Rome . \nIn announcing Jorda's return , the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th anniversary season will start at the Sherman Clay box office on Wednesday . \nGuest performers and conductors during the coming season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing with the orchestra , including violinists Yehudi Menuhin , Isaac Stern , Ruggiero Ricci and David Abel ; ; pianists Leon Fleisher , Ruth Slenczynka and Stephen Bishop and conductor Earl Bernard Murray . \n\nIntroduction . \nIn 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers . \nThese are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol Afj . \nThen in 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( A ) It has no complex of invariant lines , and ( B ) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1 . \nNo generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible . \n1 . \nLet Q be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli Afj and Afj , and let \\*\\* zg be a Afj curve of order K on Q . \n\nsentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . \nThe tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . \nThere is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes . \nThus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley's hymns are as follows . \n A charge to keep I have , A God to glorify  . \nIn the tune to which this hymn is most often sung ,  Boylston  , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have . \nDominant stress is of course more than extended duration , and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center on its first syllable rather than its last . \nBut the parallel is significant . \n"}

Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is  Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism  . \nMitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr . \nR-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel . \nThe controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club . \nIt was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs . \nHughes said Monday ,  It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired . \nNow he's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state  . \nSunday he had added ,  We can love Eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership  . \n\nreasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . \nAnd this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . \nOne such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . \nHere , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . \nTwo major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . \nThe double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define  relative costs  , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . \nFor more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses . \nBy all means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs , and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution . \n\nRookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis , 5-3 . \nThe husky 6-3 , 205-pound lefthander , was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area . \nIt was Nischwitz ' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies ' winning streak to four straight . \nThey now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American Association pack . \nNischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning . \nHe has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw . \nThe Bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in Sunday's opener , and never lagged . \nDick McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don Rudolph to open the Bear's attack . \n\nThe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.M. next Saturday . \nThe current monthly payroll comes to about $ 15,000,000 . \nHoward E. Simpson , the railroad's president , said ,  A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action  . \nThe reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates . \nSalary cut and lay-offs It will be accomplished in two ways : 1 A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions . \nThere are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class . \n2 Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense . \nSince the railroad can not reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a B. & O. spokesman said . \n\nRecent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M.D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel's impact resides in its  allegoric insight and moral metaphor  . \nJ.H. Miller's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . \nIn his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . \nThis essay seeks to make that exploration . \nDickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . \nHe knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response . \nIt is hardly accidental , therefore , that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or eccentric things with their hands . \n\nThe next question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational policy-makers . \nOn the whole , it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way . \nSeldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn . \nA hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for working-class youth . \nIn situations of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education . \nCampbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve western cities over the period of 1931 - 40 and found  little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence  , as judged by a panel of professional educators who studied the voting records on educational issues . \nThe few cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers , and such issues are not issues of educational policy . \n\nitself in the sands of the 19th Century , the grand stream of Italian Renaissance architectural decoration made a last appearance in the Brumidi frescos of the Capitol Rotunda in Washington . \nThe artistic generation after Brumidi was trained in the Paris of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution , and tended to overlook greatness of conception where faults and weakness were easy to find . \nBut it is a great conception . \nThe open ceiling , with allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky : the closed frieze , formally divided into historical scenes and tightly tied to the stone walls , belong in their large ordering to the line of Correggio and his Baroque followers . \nThe descent may be remote , but this is surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance in the United States . \nConstantino Brumidi designed the decorative scheme as a whole , in collaboration with the architect Charles U. Walter , at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of Bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure . \n"}

or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying or reducing the military effectiveness of man . \nIt is the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development , resulting in the production of BW weapons systems . \nMan may also be injured secondarily by damage to his food crops or domestic animals . \nBiological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon . \nThe major reason for this is that it has no quick-kill effect . \nThe incubation period of infectious disease , plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect , render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter . \nA man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period of most infectious diseases . \nThus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities . \n\nthe statement empirical , for goodness was not a quality like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard . \nWhat were they to do , then , with these awkward judgments of value ? ? \nTo find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically , and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery . \nIt appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only . \nIf it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at all , that they asserted nothing true or false , but merely expressed emotions like  Hurrah  or  Fiddlesticks  , then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads could be at rest . \nThis is the course the positivists took . \n\nthe eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture . \nThrough 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . \nTo reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . \nIn certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . \nThese areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . \nThe accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . \nThe process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion . \nIt was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint . \n\nthe care of five young children and concerned about persistent economic difficulties due to her husband's marginal income , her defense of denial was excessively strong . \nThus the lack of effective recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two babies showed signs of becoming a disabling problem . \nThe result , dramatically visible in a matter of days in the family's disrupted daily functioning , was a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would befall the second twin , whose birth had not been anticipated . \nSoon Mrs. B.'s fears threatened to burst into a full-blown panic concerning the welfare of the entire family . \nInability to care for the other children , difficulty in feeding the babies , who seemed colicky , bone-weary fatigue , repeated crying episodes , and short tempers reflected the family's helplessness in coping with the stressful situation . \nClearly , this was a family in crisis . \nMrs. B. compared her feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at the time of her mother's death when she was eight , as well as her subsequent anger at her father for remarrying . \n\nThe next question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational policy-makers . \nOn the whole , it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way . \nSeldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn . \nA hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for working-class youth . \nIn situations of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education . \nCampbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve western cities over the period of 1931 - 40 and found  little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence  , as judged by a panel of professional educators who studied the voting records on educational issues . \nThe few cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers , and such issues are not issues of educational policy . \n\nSt. Johns , Mich. , April 19 . \n-- A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach . \nPohl received the verdict without visible emotion . \nHe returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last July , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , Jack Walker , or his guard . \nStepson vindicated The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman's stepson , Vincent Hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in December , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict . \nMrs. Hengesbach was killed on Aug. 31 , 1958 . \nHengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since . \nWhen the verdict came in against his young neighbor , Hengesbach said :  I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed . \n\nit was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies . \nIt was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies , and with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other . \n5 . \nPoland frontiers . \nWhen the Yalta Conference opened , the American policy of postponing all discussion of Russia's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down . \nStarting in great force late in December , from a line stretching from East Prussia to Budapest , the Red armies had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the Oder , thirty miles from Berlin , and the Upper Danube region was being rapidly overrun , while the Western Allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine . \nThe long delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia's advantage . \n\nThe Poynting-Robertson effect ( Robertson , 1937 ; ; Wyatt and Whipple , 1950 ) , which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging solar radiation , causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth . \nThe radial velocity varies inversely as the particle size -- a 1000-m-diameter particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years . \nWhipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag . \nFurther , the corpuscular radiation , i.e. , the solar-wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force . \nThe Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi-major axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun . \nAlso , planetary gravitational attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached . \nAt one astronomical unit from the sun ( the Earth's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular . \n\none characteristic distinguishes Boris Godunov , it is the consistency with which every person on the stage -- including the chorus -- comes alive in the music . \nMuch of this lifelike quality results from Mussorgsky's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections . \nIn this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera ; ; such composers as Monteverdi , Lully and Purcell , with the same goal in mind , had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages . \nThrough long experimentation in his songs , Mussorgsky developed a Russian recitative as different from others as the language itself . \nGiving most of his musical continuity to the orchestra , he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence , but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words . \nThe moments of sung melody , in the usual sense , come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing , as in folk songs and liturgical chants . \n\nThe Sane Society is an ambitious work . \nIts scope is as broad as the question : What does it mean to live in modern society ? ? \nA work so broad , even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed by a moral vision , must necessarily  fail  . \nEven a hasty reader will easily find in it numerous blind spots , errors of fact and argument , important exclusions , areas of ignorance and prejudice , undue emphases on trivia , examples of broad positions supported by flimsy evidence , and the like . \nSuch books are easy prey for critics . \nNor need the critic be captious . \nA careful and orderly man , who values precision and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility , might easily be put off by such a book . \nIt is a simple matter , for one so disposed , to take a work like The Sane Society and shred it into odds and ends . \n"}

Price Daniel's  abandoned property  act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . \nDaniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . \nUnder committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . \nBut questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . \nDaniel termed  extremely conservative  his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 . \nHe told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books  since Texas was a republic  . \n\nWage-price policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces -- no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases . \nThe purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few very important industries . \nWhile there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United States since World War 2 . \nIndeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented . \nThe model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition , but which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny . \nWhere the industry's product price has been kept below the  profit-maximizing  and  entry-limiting  prices due to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . \nThe contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications . \n\nthese remarks , like most criticisms of Hardy , have tacitly assumed that his poetry is all of a piece , one solid mass of verse expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development . \nFor critics , Hardy has had no poetic periods -- one does not speak of early Hardy or late Hardy , or of the London or Max Gate period , but simply of Hardy , as of a poetic monolith . \nThis seems odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet :  Domicilium  is dated  between 1857 and 1860  ; ;  Seeing The Moon Rise  is dated August , 1927 . \nOne might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years , some changes in style and method would have occurred , some development taken place . \nThis is not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense . \nIn a time when poetic style , and poetic belief as well , seem in a state of continual flux , Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency . \nThough he struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties ; ; the  sober opinion  of his letter to Noyes , written when Hardy was eighty years old , is essentially that of his first  philosophical  notebook entry , made when he was twenty-five :  The world does not despise us : it only neglects us  ( Early Life , p. 63 ) . \n\nLos Angeles in 1957 finally bowed to the skyscraper . \n) And without high density in the core , rapid-transit systems can not be maintained economically , let alone built from scratch at today's prices . \nHowever , the building of freeways and garages can not continue forever . \nThe new interchange among the four Los Angeles freeways , including the grade-constructed accesses , occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land , one-eighth of a square mile , an area about the size of Rockefeller Center in New York . \nIt is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law calls  the highest and best use  of centrally located urban land . \nAs it affects the city's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ; ; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services . \n"}

Edward Hackstaff and Mrs. Paul Luette are planning a luncheon next week in honor of Mrs. J. Clinton Bowman , who celebrates her birthday on Tuesday . \n\n6.4 . \nThe primary decomposition theorem We are trying to study a linear operator T on the finite-dimensional space V , by decomposing T into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense elementary . \nWe can do this through the characteristic values and vectors of T in certain special cases , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial for T factors over the scalar field F into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1 . \nWhat can we do with the general T ? ? \nIf we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems . \nFirst , T may not have a single characteristic value ; ; this is really a deficiency in the scalar field , namely , that it is not algebraically closed . \n\nthe eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture . \nThrough 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . \nTo reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . \nIn certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . \nThese areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . \nThe accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . \nThe process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion . \nIt was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint . \n\nMr. Justice Black was one of the minority that rested on the Article 1 , power . \nIn this view , supported by only three members of the Court , a power denied by the specific provisions of Article 3 , was granted by the generality of Article 1 . \nIf this seems arbitrary , its effect was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally with citizens of the states -- at the expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction . \nFederal question jurisdiction For almost a hundred years we relied upon state courts ( subject to review by the Supreme Court ) for the protection of most rights arising under national law . \nThen in 1875 , apparently in response to the nationalizing influence of the Civil War , Congress first gave the lower federal courts general authority -- concurrently with state tribunals -- to decide cases involving federal-right questions . \nOne purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the Civil War amendments against state interference . \n\nThe thermal exchange of chlorine between Afj and liquid Afj is readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180-degrees and above . \nThe photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at 65-degrees using light absorbed only by the Afj . \nIn the gas phase , with Afj of Afj and Afj of Afj , quantum yields of the order of Afj have been observed at 85-degrees . \nDespite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure reagents , serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates of reaction . \nIt appears possible to set a lower limit of about Afj for the activation energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form Afj radical . \nThe rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions . \n\nA proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline Afj as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented . \nAfj is paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening . \nThe lines are asymmetric and over the range of field Afj gauss and temperature Afj the asymmetry increases with increasing Afj and decreasing T . \nAn isotropic resonance shift of Afj to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction . \nThe general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment Afj of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized to Afj . \nThe theory predicts a linear dependence of Afj on Afj , where J is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss constant . \nThe experimental second moment Afj conforms to the relation Afj in agreement with theory . \nHence , the electron paramagnetic effects ( slope ) can be separated from the nuclear effects ( intercept ) . \n\none explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium ( section 381 ( c ) ( 9 ) ) , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section 381 ( c ) ( 16 ) ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section 381 ( c ) ( 6 ) ) , but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company ( section 381 ( c ) ( 14 ) ) , but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes ? ? \nThese items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . \nThere does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities . \nWith respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 ( c ) , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation . \nTo this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute . \nIt is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes . \nSuch an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone ; ; it would certainly violate the intention of Congress as expressed in the Committee Report ; ; and in at least one instance , involving refund claims , it might be contrary to another provision of the United States Code . \nRefund claims Section 203 of the United States Code voids an assignment of a claim against the Government unless made after it has been allowed , the amount due has been ascertained , and a warrant for its payment has been issued . \n"}

Only a relative handful of such reports was received  , the jury said ,  considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city  . \nThe jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws  are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous  . \nIt recommended that Fulton legislators act  to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them  . \nThe grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said  are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments  . \nMerger proposed However , the jury said it believes  these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration  . \nThe City Purchasing Department , the jury said ,  is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies  . \n\nit was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies . \nIt was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies , and with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other . \n5 . \nPoland frontiers . \nWhen the Yalta Conference opened , the American policy of postponing all discussion of Russia's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down . \nStarting in great force late in December , from a line stretching from East Prussia to Budapest , the Red armies had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the Oder , thirty miles from Berlin , and the Upper Danube region was being rapidly overrun , while the Western Allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine . \nThe long delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia's advantage . \nThe West was now glad to propose the 1919 Curzon Line , which was substantially Russia's 1941 border , as the boundary between Russia and Poland . \n\nPlainfield -- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is  Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism  . \nMitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr . \nR-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel . \nThe controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club . \nIt was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs . \nHughes said Monday ,  It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired . \nNow he's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state  . \n\nWage-price policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces -- no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases . \nThe purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few very important industries . \nWhile there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United States since World War 2 . \nIndeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented . \nThe model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition , but which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny . \nWhere the industry's product price has been kept below the  profit-maximizing  and  entry-limiting  prices due to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . \n\nWashington on President-elect John F.

Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday . \nThe disclosure by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial . \nBellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan Clements , 30 , a separate trial . \nBellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom . \nFears prejudicial aspects  The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client  , Bellows told the court . \n Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property . \nIt is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others  . \n\nThe nation the three-front war At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad . \nAfterward , Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen . \nWhat Herter presented , said Gore , was  not a very encouraging review  . \nThat was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts . \nWhile Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . \n1 ) Cuba . \nHours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery , Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens , plus 120 Cuban employees ) . \nPresident Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately . \n\nthe Midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas . \nThe high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume . \nResearch at Fayette , Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg with loadings from 8 to 120 lb . \nSince experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds . \nRecent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer . \nTheir study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen hr . \nhp . \n. \n\nPurification of the conjugates In attempting to improve specificity of staining , the fluorescein-labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways : ( 1 ) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders ( Coons , 1958 ) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( E.F. Smith & Townsend ) on sweet clover stems . \n( 2 ) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 - 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems . \nThe proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of Afj in Afj to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80 % saturation with Afj . \nThe precipitate was washed twice with an 80 % saturated solution of Afj , dissolved in a small quantity of 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer , dialyzed against cold distilled water till free from ammonium ions , and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen . \n( 3 ) In other experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade ( 1957 ) . \n( 4 ) The conjugates were passed through a diethylaminoethyl ( DEAE ) cellulose column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer ( PBS ) containing Afj potassium phosphate and Afj . \n\nUnemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . \nSome vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . \nCurrent programs The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home economics . \nSince 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . \nThe George-Barden Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith Act . \nThe Health Amendment Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical nurse training . \nThe latest major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden Act . \n"}

\n\nOslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . \nThis has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . \nIn Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems . \nThis atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the  colonialist  powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . \nThe nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . \nExplosion avoided In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should

therapy , with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use . \nAlthough biopsies have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid-induced weakness , this case provides the only example known to us in which necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups . \nThe case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of steroids for a refractory anemia . \nReport of case This patient was a 65-year-old white male accountant who entered the New York Hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26 , 1959 , because of disabling weakness and general debility . \nIn 1953 the patient developed an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood

\n\nSalem ( special ) -- For a second month in a row , Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday . \nIt is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . \nWilliam Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $ 58,918 out of its budgeted $ 66,000 in the category , leaving only $ 7,082 for the rest of the month . \nAt the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $ 17,000 . \nBut it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . \nNo request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . \nBoard oks pact The commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , Roy Webster , of Hood River , and Dr. Ennis Keizer , of North Bend , approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past . \nThe contract with Ray Field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $ 8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month . \n\nAnglo-Saxon and Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age . \nHrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at Finnsburg ( lines 1068 - 1159 ) , and improvises the tale of Beowulf's exploits in a complimentary comparison of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund ( lines 871 - 892 ) ; ; Alcinous ' court bard sings of the discovered adultery of Ares and Aphrodite ( Odyssey 8 266-366 ) , and takes up a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens on ( Odyssey 8 499-520 ) . \nNothing in all this is autobiographical : unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith , the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ; the poet of The Odyssey , reputed blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel Demodocus . \nSince none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter , there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition . \nThat such a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey , at least , is hard to deny . \nMilman Parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant Homeric poems are largely formulaic , and was led to postulate that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of Greek epic survived ; ; he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition , and assumed the slightly less likely corollary that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas . \nProceeding from Parry's conclusions and adopting one of his schemata , Francis P. Magoun , Jr. , argues that Beowulf likewise was created from a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive generations , and the thesis is striking and compelling . \nYet a fresh inspection will indicate one crucial amendment : Beowulf and the Homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent . \n\nsentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . \nThe tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . \nThere is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes . \nThus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley's hymns are as follows . \n A charge to keep I have , A God to glorify  . \nIn the tune to which this hymn is most often sung ,  Boylston  , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have . \nDominant stress is of course more than extended duration , and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center on its first syllable rather than its last . \n\nThose whom I wish to address with this letter are for the most part unknown to me . \nIt may well be that , when Rudy Pozzatti and I visited your country last spring , you were living and working close to the places we saw and the streets we walked . \nAs American artists , it was natural that we would want to meet as many Soviet artists as possible . \nThis letter might not have been necessary had our efforts to meet and talk with you been more successful . \nEven though we did not see many of your faces , it appears now quite evident that a considerable number of your profession heard , from those whom we had the fortune to encounter , that we had been in your midst . \nI am very pleased that quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to hear of our reactions and experiences in the U.S.S.R . \n. \n\nAnalysis Analysis means the evaluation of subparts , the comparative ratings of parts , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements . \nAnalysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts . \nImpersonal purposes Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals . \nRoleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals . \nFor example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying . \nExamples Let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis . \nOne should keep in mind that many of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas . \n\nThe Summary Report On Desegregation Progress In Education In The Middle-South Region , 1959 - 1960  clearly shows two pieces of information . \nThe Summary Report , which was prepared for this Conference , indicates , first , that actual or pending school desegregation is increasing ; ; second , that both actual and pending desegregation is , with few exceptions , the product or result of court order . \nThe Report together with other information suggests that desegregation in the schools is slow . \nThe Middle-South Region , as defined by the National Association of Intergroup Relations Officials ( NAIRO ) , consists of the states of Kentucky , Maryland , Tennessee , West Virginia , Delaware , Virginia and the District of Columbia . \nThe states and the Nation's Capital all have some desegregation , in fact some dating back to 1954 ; ; but the region also embraces some of the staunchest opposition . \nDesegregation has been opposed by massive resistance , interposition , pupil assignment ( with no assignments of Negro children ) , and hate bombings . \n"}

Walter , at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of Bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure . \n\nthe effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) . \nB. Organification of iodine The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood . \nHowever , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . \nIn the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ; De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) . \nThis iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems . \nIn addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . \nIf tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) . \nIt is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue . \n\nOslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . \nThis has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . \nIn Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems . \nThis atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the  colonialist  powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . \nThe nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . \nExplosion avoided In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . \n\nAn analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts . \nFirst is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion . \nPreparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes . \nAll political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination . \nThe second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting . \nConsiderable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach . \n\nResentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates . \nAt the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable . \nSome anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years . \nThe resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders . \nSome viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party . \nOpposition reported Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary . \nThese contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr. Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city . \n\nseven months , the Garden of the Gods Club will have its gala summer opening Saturday , June 3 . \nMusic for dancing will be furnished by Allen Uhles and his orchestra , who will play each Saturday during June . \nMembers and guests will be in for an added surprise with the new wing containing 40 rooms and suites , each with its own private patio . \nGene Marshall , genial manager of the club , has announced that the Garden of the Gods will open to members Thursday , June 1 . \nBeginning July 4 , there will be an orchestra playing nightly except Sunday and Monday for the summer season . \nMrs. J.

Grenier , clerk of the board , said that the appeals will be reviewed in December at the time the board is visiting new construction sites in the town for assessment purposes . \nThey also will visit properties on which appeals have been made . \nAny adjustments which are made , Mr. Grenier said earlier this month , will appear on the balance of the tax bill since most of the town's taxpayers take the option of paying quarterly with the balance due next year . \nJohn Pezza , 69 , of 734 Hartford Avenue , Providence , complained of shoulder pains after an accident in which a car he was driving collided with a car driven by Antonio Giorgio , 25 , of 12 DeSoto St. , Providence , on Greenville Avenue and Cherry Hill Road in Johnston yesterday . \n"}

Armour . \nThe bridegroom's children were here for the Christmas holidays and ca n't return . \n\nthe care of five young children and concerned about persistent economic difficulties due to her husband's marginal income , her defense of denial was excessively strong . \nThus the lack of effective recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two babies showed signs of becoming a disabling problem . \nThe result , dramatically visible in a matter of days in the family's disrupted daily functioning , was a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would befall the second twin , whose birth had not been anticipated . \nSoon Mrs. B.'s fears threatened to burst into a full-blown panic concerning the welfare of the entire family . \nInability to care for the other children , difficulty in feeding the babies , who seemed colicky , bone-weary fatigue , repeated crying episodes , and short tempers reflected the family's helplessness in coping with the stressful situation . \nClearly , this was a family in crisis . \n\nthe hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week . \nFor many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous . \nIt was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ; ; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell . \nInvestors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many . \nIn fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares . \nSome Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers . \nA measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began . \n\nA band viscometer is shown in Figure 2 . \nIt consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims . \nThere is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed . \nA tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks . \nIn normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks . \nAfter it has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded . \nBy the use of various weights , data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtained . \nThe instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described . \n\nControl of socioeconomic status It would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being investigated : the degree of structure in teaching method . \nThe structured schools were in an industrial city , with three-family tenement houses typical of the residential areas , but with one rather sizable section of middle-class homes . \nThe unstructured schools were in a large suburban community , predominantly middle - to upper-middle class , but fringed by an industrial area . \nIn order to equate the samples on socioeconomic status , we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods . \nSchool principals and guidance workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas . \nAn objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data . \n"}

the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . \nOne such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . \nHere , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . \nTwo major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . \nThe double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define  relative costs  , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . \nFor more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses . \nBy all means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs , and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution . \n\na simple , closed , plane curve C which is a real-analytic image of the unit circle , and which is given by Afj . \nThese are real analytic periodic

has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo , and Cairns to show that in Afj there are families of such cubes . \nHere , for the case of squares inscribed in plane curves , we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other results . \nA square inscribed in a curve C means a square with its four corner points on the curve , though it may not lie entirely in the interior of C . \nIndeed ,

\nThe lines are asymmetric and over the range of field Afj gauss and temperature Afj the asymmetry increases with increasing Afj and decreasing T . \nAn isotropic resonance shift of Afj to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction . \nThe general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment Afj of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized to Afj . \nThe theory predicts a linear dependence of Afj on Afj , where J is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss constant . \nThe experimental second moment Afj conforms to the relation Afj in agreement with theory . \n\nIt is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels . \nNo single explanation is adequate to account for this . \nImprovement , however , is urgent , and at least three things will be needed . \nThe first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses . \nEven beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant systems , both in their general outlines and in many specific details . \nAn advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems , including some of the more unusual types . \nBy contrast , even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the over-simple distinction between register and contour languages . \nThis limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone . \n\n9 . \nMartin and Stendler present evidence that infants and young children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual level simply by combining objects and counting them . \nAfter they have developed concepts , they are free from the necessity of manipulating objects ; ; they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely . \nThe ability to think seems to increase consistently with age . \nOne experiment showed the greatest one-year difference occurring between the eleventh and twelfth years . \n10 . \nMany studies indicate that elementary-school children's interests cover the whole field of science ; ; that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes and events ; ; and that as they mature their interests and capabilities change and broaden . \nEmotional characteristics How a child feels about himself , about other people , and about the tasks confronting him in school may have as much influence on his success in school as his physical and intellectual characteristics . \n"}

Beame as running mates . \nAt the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable . \nSome anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years . \nThe resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders . \nSome viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party . \nOpposition reported Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary . \nThese contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr. Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city . \nTheir view is that last-minute changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as Mayor . \n\nSt. Johns , Mich. , April 19 . \n-- A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach . \nPohl received the verdict without visible emotion . \nHe returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last July , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , Jack Walker , or his guard . \nStepson vindicated The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman's stepson , Vincent Hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in December , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict . \nMrs. Hengesbach was killed on Aug. 31 , 1958 . \nHengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since . \nWhen the verdict came in against his young neighbor , Hengesbach said :  I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed . \n\nMickey Charles Mantle , the New York Yankees ' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime . \nWhen Roger Eugene Maris , Mantle's muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe . \nBut when tiny , 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained ,  the other team thought no one was out there  , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous . \nThis is Baseball 1961 . \nThis is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous . \nIt is the year when ( 1 ) amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and , in unprecedented style , delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs ; ; ( 2 ) Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game ; ; ( 3 ) the Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them ; ; and ( 4 ) catcher Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter . \nPitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal . \nExperts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused by expansion . \n\nThe Sane Society is an ambitious work . \nIts scope is as broad as the question : What does it mean to live in modern society ? ? \nA work so broad , even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed by a moral vision , must necessarily  fail  . \nEven a hasty reader will easily find in it numerous blind spots , errors of fact and argument , important exclusions , areas of ignorance and prejudice , undue emphases on trivia , examples of broad positions supported by flimsy evidence , and the like . \nSuch books are easy prey for critics . \nNor need the critic be captious . \nA careful and orderly man , who values precision and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility , might easily be put off by such a book . \nIt is a simple matter , for one so disposed , to take a work like The Sane Society and shred it into odds and ends . \n\nOrganization : In this publication measurements of interfacial angles of crystals are used to classify and identify chemical substances . \nT.V. Barker , who developed the classification-angle system , was about to begin the systematic compilation of the index when he died in 1931 . \nThe compilation work was undertaken by a number of interested crystallographers in the Department of Mineralogy of the University Museum at Oxford . \nSince 1948 the working headquarters has been the Department of Geology and Mineralogy . \nNumerous cooperating individuals in Great Britain , Holland , the United States , and Belgium have contributed editorially or by making calculations . \nGreat interest and practical help have been given by the Barker Index Committee . \nFinancial and material help have come from academic , governmental , and industrial organizations in England and Holland . \n\nThe preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined by the sociologist . \nLike primitive numbers in mathematics , the entire axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth . \nBut what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduces the idea of physical models ? ? \nIs it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred canons in social science ? ? \nIt has become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by erecting mathematical and physical models , is itself a conditioned response to a world which pays a premium price for technological manipulation . \nThis push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word  mass  to mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals in such a group can be studied . \n\nA band viscometer is shown in Figure 2 . \nIt consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims . \nThere is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed . \nA tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks . \nIn normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks . \nAfter it has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded . \nBy the use of various weights , data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtained . \n\nSanta Barbara --  The present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn  , Beryl W. Sprinkel , economist of Harris Trust & Savings Bank , Chicago , predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn. , California group , conference . \nAnother speaker , William H. Draper , Jr. , former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper , Gaither & Anderson , urged the U.S. to  throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we wo n't be pushed around any more  . \nHe urged support for President Kennedy's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations . \n' not flash in pan ' Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a  temporary flash in the pan  but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern . \n In view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial  he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but  there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960  . \nThesis refuted Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism  is based on very limited and questionable evidence  . \nRather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth  , he said  it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery  . \n\n2 : : Some of the major functions of religion The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; ; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . \nIn societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . \nWith the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . \nNevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . \nAlthough the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . \nIf the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . \nThere are several closely related inner functions . \nIn the last analysis , religion is the means of inducing , formulating , expressing , enhancing , implementing , and perpetuating man's deepest experience -- the religious . \n\nit was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies . \nIt was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies , and with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other . \n5 . \nPoland frontiers . \nWhen the Yalta Conference opened , the American policy of postponing all discussion of Russia's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down . \nStarting in great force late in December , from a line stretching from East Prussia to Budapest , the Red armies had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the Oder , thirty miles from Berlin , and the Upper Danube region was being rapidly overrun , while the Western Allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine . \nThe long delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia's advantage . \n"}

space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers . \nThese are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol Afj . \nThen in 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( A ) It has no complex of invariant lines , and ( B ) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1 . \nNo generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible . \n1 . \n\nWage-price policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces -- no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases . \nThe purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few very important industries . \nWhile there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United States since World War 2 . \nIndeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented . \nThe model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition , but which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny . \nWhere the industry's product price has been kept below the  profit-maximizing  and  entry-limiting  prices due to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . \nThe contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications . \nIn order to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of  public-limit pricing  on  key  wage bargains , we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces , such as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation . \n\nSome of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . \nFirst , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . \nIn contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls . \nThe Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . \nSecond , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . \nAlthough the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . \nThird , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children . \n\nAbstract Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) . \nThus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . \nIt was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy . \nA detailed energy balance of the anode was established . \nThe anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount . \nThe dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Afj . \nQualitative observations were made and high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities . \nIntroduction The high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation . \n\nEnrique Jorda , conductor and musical director of the San Francisco Symphony , will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in Europe before returning home to open the symphony's Golden Anniversary season , it was announced . \nThe guest assignments are scheduled for November 14 and 18 , with the Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana in Palermo and the Orchestra of Radio Cologne . \nThe season in San Francisco will open with a special Gala Concert on November 22 . \nDuring his five-month visit abroad , Jorda recently conducted the Orchestre Philharmonique De Bordeau in France , and the Santa Cecilia Orchestra in Rome . \nIn announcing Jorda's return , the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th anniversary season will start at the Sherman Clay box office on Wednesday . \nGuest performers and conductors during the coming season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing with the orchestra , including violinists Yehudi Menuhin , Isaac Stern , Ruggiero Ricci and David Abel ; ; pianists Leon Fleisher , Ruth Slenczynka and Stephen Bishop and conductor Earl Bernard Murray . \nThe Leningrad Kirov Ballet , which opened a series of performances Friday night at the Opera House , is , I think , the finest  classical  ballet company I have ever seen , and the production of the Petipa-Tschaikowsky  Sleeping Beauty  with which it began the series is incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing . \nThis work is no favorite of mine . \n\ninvisible , modern revolt , like X-rays and radioactivity , is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels , where it is called delinquency . \n Disaffiliation  , by the way , is the term used by the critic and poet , Lawrence Lipton , who has written several articles on this subject , the first of which , in The Nation , quoted as Epigraph :  We disaffiliate . \n -- John L. Lewis . \nLike the pillars of Hercules , like two ruined Titans guarding the entrance to one of Dante's circles , stand two great dead juvenile delinquents -- the heroes of the post-war generation : the great saxophonist , Charlie Parker , and Dylan Thomas . \nIf the word deliberate means anything , both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves . \nBoth of them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves , because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical art . \nBoth of them were my friends . \nLiving in San Francisco I saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted by exasperation or fatigue . \n\nThe Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced  no evidence  that any irregularities took place . \nThe jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election ,  deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta  for the manner in which the election was conducted . \nThe September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible  irregularities  in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr ..  Only a relative handful of such reports was received  , the jury said ,  considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city  . \nThe jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws  are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous  . \nIt recommended that Fulton legislators act  to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them  . \nThe grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said  are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments  . \n\nThe Poynting-Robertson effect ( Robertson , 1937 ; ; Wyatt and Whipple , 1950 ) , which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging solar radiation , causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth . \nThe radial velocity varies inversely as the particle size -- a 1000-m-diameter particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years . \nWhipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag . \nFurther , the corpuscular radiation , i.e. , the solar-wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force . \nThe Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi-major axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun . \nAlso , planetary gravitational attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached . \nAt one astronomical unit from the sun ( the Earth's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular . \nIf such is the case , the particles within a distance of about Afj of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic energy less than their potential energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth . \n\nIt is not easy for the therapist to discern when , in the patient's communicating , an introject has appeared and is holding sway . \nOne learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone -- to his voice's suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , parrot-like . \nThe content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition , as if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove ; ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over and over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him . \nOne hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo-emotion , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her . \nEventually such incidents became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior -- which , as usual , went on without any accompanying words from her -- she asked , eagerly ,  Did you see Granny  ? ? \nAt first I did not know what she meant ; ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother , in their distant home-city . \n\nAbstract Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) . \nThus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . \nIt was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy . \nA detailed energy balance of the anode was established . \nThe anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount . \nThe dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Afj . \n"}

Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday . \nThe disclosure by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial . \nBellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan Clements , 30 , a separate trial . \nBellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom . \nFears prejudicial aspects  The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client  , Bellows told the court . \n Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property . \nIt is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others  . \nJudge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired ,  You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this  ? ? \n"}

Organification of iodine The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood . \nHowever , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . \nIn the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ; De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) . \nThis iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems . \nIn addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . \n\nRookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis , 5-3 . \nThe husky 6-3 , 205-pound lefthander , was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area . \nIt was Nischwitz ' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies ' winning streak to four straight . \nThey now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American Association pack . \nNischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning . \nHe has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw . \n\nMany other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length . \nLaurence M. Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes , and Charles C. Carpenter's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes ( Thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults . \nFelix Kopstein states that  when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length  , but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity . \nIt is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity ; ; he was working with species of Java , so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect . \nCertain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions . \nAdditional records of slow growth have been omitted . \nIt is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves . \n\nSalem ( special ) -- For a second month in a row , Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday . \nIt is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . \nWilliam Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $ 58,918 out of its budgeted $ 66,000 in the category , leaving only $ 7,082 for the rest of the month . \nAt the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $ 17,000 . \nBut it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . \nNo request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . \nBoard oks pact The commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , Roy Webster , of Hood River , and Dr. Ennis Keizer , of North Bend , approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past . \nThe contract with Ray Field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $ 8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month . \n\nA Night in New Orleans  is the gayety planned by members of the Thrift Shop Committee for May 6 at Philmont Country Club . \nThe women have a reputation for giving parties that are different and are fun and this year's promises to follow in this fine tradition . \nMrs. H.J. Grinsfelder is chairman . \nThe Louisiana city is known , of course , for its fine food , good music and its colorful hospitality  and , when guests arrive at Philmont that night  , says Mrs. Grinsfelder ,  that is exactly what we expect to offer them . \nWe 've been working for weeks . \nThe prospects look great . \nWe are keeping a number of surprises under our hats . \n\nAustin , Texas -- A Texas halfback who does n't even know the team's plays , Eldon Moritz , ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three games . \nTime stands still every time Moritz , a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran , goes into the field . \nAlthough he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick -- several every Saturday , in fact -- out of football . \nMoritz does n't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl . \nThat's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries . \nHe ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington State . \n\nit was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies . \nIt was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies , and with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other . \n5 . \nPoland frontiers . \nWhen the Yalta Conference opened , the American policy of postponing all discussion of Russia's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down . \nStarting in great force late in December , from a line stretching from East Prussia to Budapest , the Red armies had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the Oder , thirty miles from Berlin , and the Upper Danube region was being rapidly overrun , while the Western Allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine . \nThe long delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia's advantage . \nThe West was now glad to propose the 1919 Curzon Line , which was substantially Russia's 1941 border , as the boundary between Russia and Poland . \n\nthe century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law . \nSeveral factors contributed to this change . \nThe Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow . \nHere in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . \nThus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century . \nInternational law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . \nEssentially this imposed two conditions : First , international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; ; second , it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared . \nIn both respects , international law was Europeanized . \n\n7-1 . \nExamples of binomial experiments Some experiments are composed of repetitions of independent trials , each with two possible outcomes . \nThe binomial probability distribution may describe the variation that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment to another . \nWe devote a chapter to the binomial distribution not only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real life phenomena , but also because it has important properties that recur in many other probability models . \nWe begin with a few examples of binomial experiments . \nMarksmanship example . \nA trained marksman shooting five rounds at a target , all under practically the same conditions , may hit the bull's-eye from 0 to 5 times . \nIn repeated sets of five shots his numbers of bull's-eyes vary . \n\nThe preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined by the sociologist . \nLike primitive numbers in mathematics , the entire axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth . \nBut what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduces the idea of physical models ? ? \nIs it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred canons in social science ? ? \nIt has become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by erecting mathematical and physical models , is itself a conditioned response to a world which pays a premium price for technological manipulation . \nThis push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word  mass  to mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals in such a group can be studied . \n( cf. Rapoport , 1959 : : Ch. 11 . \n) Here I think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent . \n"}

John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws . \nOnce more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally . \nOr , in the words of Anatole France ,  The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges  . \nThe public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites . \nThe Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program . \nIn addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill . \nIt is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers ' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike . \n\nPurification of the conjugates In attempting to improve specificity of staining , the fluorescein-labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways : ( 1 ) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders ( Coons , 1958 ) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( E.F. Smith & Townsend ) on sweet clover stems . \n( 2 ) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 - 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems . \nThe proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of Afj in Afj to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80 % saturation with Afj . \nThe precipitate was washed twice with an 80 % saturated solution of Afj , dissolved in a small quantity of 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer , dialyzed against cold distilled water till free from ammonium ions , and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen . \n( 3 ) In other experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade ( 1957 ) . \n( 4 ) The conjugates were passed through a diethylaminoethyl ( DEAE ) cellulose column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer ( PBS ) containing Afj potassium phosphate and Afj . \nPreparation of frozen sections The technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that described by Coons et al ( 1951 ) . \n\nMiami , Fla. , March 17 -- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . \nIndications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage . \nSiebern hits homer Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . \nThen Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock . \nA two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . \nHouse throws wild With one down in the eighth , Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle . \nCatcher Frank House's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt . \nThen Heywood Sullivan , Kansas City catcher , singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run . \n\nThe plant was located west of the Battenkill and south of the location of the former electric light plant . \nThe Manchester Depot Sewer Company issued 214 shares of stock at $ 10 each for construction of a sewer in that locality , and assessments were made for its maintenance . \nIt has given considerable trouble at times and empties right into the Battenkill . \nFire District No. 1 discussed its possible purchase in 1945 , but considered it an unwise investment . \nThe sewer on Bonnet Street was constructed when there were only a few houses on the street . \nAs new homes were built they were connected so that all residences south of School Street are served by it . \n\nreasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . \nAnd this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . \nOne such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . \nHere , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . \nTwo major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . \nThe double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define  relative costs  , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . \nFor more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses . \n\nThe injured German veteran was a former miner , twenty-four years old , who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head . \nThis resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also . \nIn any event , the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became  psychically blind  , while at the same time , apparently , the sense of touch remained essentially intact . \nPsychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images , a condition in which , for example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence . \nThis circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever . \nThe necessary inference , as the authors themselves interpret it , would seem to be this :  ( ( 1 ) Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense of touch , as such . \nWe do not arrive at spatial images by means of the sense of touch by itself . \n( 2 ) Spatiality becomes part of the tactual sensation only by way of visual representations ; ; that is , there is , in the true sense , only a visual space  . \n\nit is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief  structuring  experience . \nIt was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal , concretistic reports of what the ambiguous figure  looked like  as reflecting their hesitancy about taking chances . \nThis was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action . \nResponses such as  rope with a loop in it  , and  two pieces of rope  , were quite characteristic . \nGuilford-Martin personality inventories . \nThe three personality inventories ( Guilford ; ; Guilford-Martin ; ; Guilford-Martin ) were filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects . \nThese were the same subjects who were given the Rorschach test . \n\nThe nation the three-front war At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad . \nAfterward , Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen . \nWhat Herter presented , said Gore , was  not a very encouraging review  . \nThat was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts . \nWhile Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . \n1 ) Cuba . \nHours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery , Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens , plus 120 Cuban employees ) . \n"}

; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture . \nThrough 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . \nTo reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . \nIn certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . \nThese areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . \nThe accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . \nThe process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion . \nIt was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint . \n\nThe injured German veteran was a former miner , twenty-four years old , who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head . \nThis resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also . \nIn any event , the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became  psychically blind  , while at the same time , apparently , the sense of touch remained essentially intact . \nPsychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images , a condition in which , for example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence . \nThis circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever . \nThe necessary inference , as the authors themselves interpret it , would seem to be this :  ( ( 1 ) Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense of touch , as such . \nWe do not arrive at spatial images by means of the sense of touch by itself . \n\nThe vast Central Valley of California is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world . \nDuring the summer of 1960 , it became the setting for a bitter and basic labor-management struggle . \nThe contestants in this economic struggle are the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee ( AWOC ) of the AFL-CIO and the agricultural employers of the State . \nBy virtue of the legal responsibilities of the Department of Employment in the farm placement program , we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces . \nIt is not a pleasant or easy position , but one we have endeavored to maintain . \nWe have sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties , but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose . \nInevitably , one side was pleased and the other displeased , regardless of how we ruled . \nOften the displeased parties interpreted our decision as implying favoritism toward the other . \n\none explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium ( section 381 ( c ) ( 9 ) ) , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section 381 ( c ) ( 16 ) ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section 381 ( c ) ( 6 ) ) , but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company ( section 381 ( c ) ( 14 ) ) , but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes ? ? \nThese items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . \nThere does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities . \nWith respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 ( c ) , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation . \nTo this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute . \nIt is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes . \nSuch an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone ; ; it would certainly violate the intention of Congress as expressed in the Committee Report ; ; and in at least one instance , involving refund claims , it might be contrary to another provision of the United States Code . \n\nThe following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the operands of those instructions which refer to the particular items : channel , unit , combined channel and unit , combined arm and file , unit record synchronizers , inquiry synchronizers , and alteration switches . \nThe declarative operation EQU is used to equate symbolic names to item numbers ( see page 85 ) . \nContinuation cards Certain Autocoder statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained in the operand ( columns 21 - 75 ) of a single line on the Autocoder coding sheet . \nWhen this is the case , the appropriate section of this manual will indicate that  Continuation Cards  may be used . \nThus , when specifically permitted , the operand of a given line on the Autocoder coding sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to four additional lines which immediately follow . \nThe label and operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand must begin in column 21 ; ; i.e. , it must be left-justified in the operand column of the coding sheet . \n\nPlainfield -- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is  Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism  . \nMitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr . \nR-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel . \nThe controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club . \nIt was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs . \nHughes said Monday ,  It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired . \nNow he's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state  . \n\nreasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . \nAnd this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . \nOne such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . \nHere , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . \nTwo major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . \nThe double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define  relative costs  , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . \n\nControl of socioeconomic status It would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being investigated : the degree of structure in teaching method . \nThe structured schools were in an industrial city , with three-family tenement houses typical of the residential areas , but with one rather sizable section of middle-class homes . \nThe unstructured schools were in a large suburban community , predominantly middle - to upper-middle class , but fringed by an industrial area . \nIn order to equate the samples on socioeconomic status , we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods . \nSchool principals and guidance workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas . \nAn objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data . \n\nResentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates . \nAt the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable . \nSome anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years . \nThe resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders . \nSome viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party . \nOpposition reported Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary . \n"}

Bowden stated . \nBut an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes . \nThe statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated . \n Emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions  , the statement said . \nThe statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation . \nAn Emory spokesman indicated , however , that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws . \nThe Georgia Constitution gives the Legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if , among other criteria ,  all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people , and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people  . \n\nRecent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M.D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel's impact resides in its  allegoric insight and moral metaphor  . \nJ.H. Miller's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . \nIn his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . \nThis essay seeks to make that exploration . \nDickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . \nHe knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response . \n\nSome of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . \nFirst , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . \nIn contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls . \nThe Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . \nSecond , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . \nAlthough the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . \n\nCook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrested him . \nThinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him . \nEven while suffering the trip to his home , Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian . \nThree weeks later , following his recovery , armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney , Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez . \nArriving at daybreak , they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender . \nInstead , he whirled and ran to his house for a gun , forcing them to kill him , Cook reported . \n\nit was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies . \nIt was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies , and with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other . \n5 . \nPoland frontiers . \nWhen the Yalta Conference opened , the American policy of postponing all discussion of Russia's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down . \nStarting in great force late in December , from a line stretching from East Prussia to Budapest , the Red armies had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the Oder , thirty miles from Berlin , and the Upper Danube region was being rapidly overrun , while the Western Allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine . \nThe long delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia's advantage . \nThe West was now glad to propose the 1919 Curzon Line , which was substantially Russia's 1941 border , as the boundary between Russia and Poland . \n"}

High-gain photoelectronic image intensification may be achieved by several methods ; ; some of these are listed below : ( A ) Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems , ( B ) Channel-type , secondary emission image intensifier , ( C ) Image intensifier based upon the  multipactor  principle , ( D ) Transmission secondary electron multiplication image intensifiers ( TSEM tubes ) , ( E ) Cascading of single stages , enclosed in one common envelope . \nCascading single stages by coupling lens systems is rather inefficient as the lens systems limit the obtainable gain quite severely . \nChannel-type image intensifiers are capable of achieving high-gain values ; ; they suffer , however , from an inherently low resolution . \nImage intensifiers based upon the multipactor principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable resolution is concerned . \nHowever , the unavoidable low-duty cycle restricts the effective gain . \n\nthese remarks , like most criticisms of Hardy , have tacitly assumed that his poetry is all of a piece , one solid mass of verse expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development . \nFor critics , Hardy has had no poetic periods -- one does not speak of early Hardy or late Hardy , or of the London or Max Gate period , but simply of Hardy , as of a poetic monolith . \nThis seems odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet :  Domicilium  is dated  between 1857 and 1860  ; ;  Seeing The Moon Rise  is dated August , 1927 . \nOne might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years , some changes in style and method would have occurred , some development taken place . \nThis is not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense . \nIn a time when poetic style , and poetic belief as well , seem in a state of continual flux , Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency . \nThough he struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties ; ; the  sober opinion  of his letter to Noyes , written when Hardy was eighty years old , is essentially that of his first  philosophical  notebook entry , made when he was twenty-five :  The world does not despise us : it only neglects us  ( Early Life , p. 63 ) . \n\nPurification of the conjugates In attempting to improve specificity of staining , the fluorescein-labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways : ( 1 ) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders ( Coons , 1958 ) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( E.F. Smith & Townsend ) on sweet clover stems . \n( 2 ) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 - 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems . \nThe proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of Afj in Afj to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80 % saturation with Afj . \nThe precipitate was washed twice with an 80 % saturated solution of Afj , dissolved in a small quantity of 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer , dialyzed against cold distilled water till free from ammonium ions , and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen . \n( 3 ) In other experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade ( 1957 ) . \n( 4 ) The conjugates were passed through a diethylaminoethyl ( DEAE ) cellulose column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer ( PBS ) containing Afj potassium phosphate and Afj . \n\nThe Summary Report On Desegregation Progress In Education In The Middle-South Region , 1959 - 1960  clearly shows two pieces of information . \nThe Summary Report , which was prepared for this Conference , indicates , first , that actual or pending school desegregation is increasing ; ; second , that both actual and pending desegregation is , with few exceptions , the product or result of court order . \nThe Report together with other information suggests that desegregation in the schools is slow . \nThe Middle-South Region , as defined by the National Association of Intergroup Relations Officials ( NAIRO ) , consists of the states of Kentucky , Maryland , Tennessee , West Virginia , Delaware , Virginia and the District of Columbia . \nThe states and the Nation's Capital all have some desegregation , in fact some dating back to 1954 ; ; but the region also embraces some of the staunchest opposition . \nDesegregation has been opposed by massive resistance , interposition , pupil assignment ( with no assignments of Negro children ) , and hate bombings . \nDesegregation and court order Now let's look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation and such increase as a result of court order . \nFirst Kentucky . \n\nseven months , the Garden of the Gods Club will have its gala summer opening Saturday , June 3 . \nMusic for dancing will be furnished by Allen Uhles and his orchestra , who will play each Saturday during June . \nMembers and guests will be in for an added surprise with the new wing containing 40 rooms and suites , each with its own private patio . \nGene Marshall , genial manager of the club , has announced that the Garden of the Gods will open to members Thursday , June 1 . \nBeginning July 4 , there will be an orchestra playing nightly except Sunday and Monday for the summer season . \nMrs. J. Edward Hackstaff and Mrs. Paul Luette are planning a luncheon next week in honor of Mrs. J. Clinton Bowman , who celebrates her birthday on Tuesday . \n\nthis evidence in mind , the writer began to plan how he might more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes . \nToward the end of the semester's work , he interviewed every married class member at great length . \nHe found , as he had suspected , a general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed course was not really functional for these students . \nHowever , all admitted that the  hindsight  was not altogether lost . \nIn their own words , it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they had gotten into their marriages , and perhaps they had obtained some insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time . \nIn fact , they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design a section exclusively for married students there should be , at the beginning , some  hindsight  study ; ; but they all hastened to add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent . \nAll of them felt a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course . \nA few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section for married students . \n\nRecent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M.D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel's impact resides in its  allegoric insight and moral metaphor  . \nJ.H.

Barker , who developed the classification-angle system , was about to begin the systematic compilation of the index when he died in 1931 . \nThe compilation work was undertaken by a number of interested crystallographers in the Department of Mineralogy of the University Museum at Oxford . \nSince 1948 the working headquarters has been the Department of Geology and Mineralogy . \nNumerous cooperating individuals in Great Britain , Holland , the United States , and Belgium have contributed editorially or by making calculations . \nGreat interest and practical help have been given by the Barker Index Committee . \nFinancial and material help have come from academic , governmental , and industrial organizations in England and Holland . \n\nRookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis , 5-3 . \nThe husky 6-3 , 205-pound lefthander , was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area . \nIt was Nischwitz ' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies ' winning streak to four straight . \nThey now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American Association pack . \nNischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning . \nHe has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw . \nThe Bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in Sunday's opener , and never lagged . \nDick McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don Rudolph to open the Bear's attack . \n\nAppointment of William S. Pfaff Jr. , 41 , as promotion manager of The Times-Picayune Publishing Company was announced Saturday by John F.

questionnaire method There were two methods that could have been used for conducting the study within the resources available : ( 1 ) interviews in depth with a few selected companies , and ( 2 ) the more limited interrogation of a large number of companies by means of a mail questionnaire . \nWhile the method of interviewing a small number of companies was appealing because of the opportunity it might have furnished to probe fully the reasons and circumstances of a company's practices and opinions , it also involved the risk of paying undue attention to the unique and peculiar problems of just a few individual companies . \nAs a result , it was decided that a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more effective in determining the general practices and opinions of small firms and in highlighting some of the fundamental and recurring problems of defense procurement that concern both industry and government . \nIt was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest fruitful inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more detailed nature . \nIt is recognized that a mail questionnaire has inherent limitations . \nThere is the danger that the questions will mean different things to different respondents . \nSimple  yes  or  no  answers do not reveal the different shades of opinion that the various respondents may have . \n\nWage-price policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces -- no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases . \nThe purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few very important industries . \nWhile there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United States since World War 2 . \nIndeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented . \nThe model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition , but which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny . \nWhere the industry's product price has been kept below the  profit-maximizing  and  entry-limiting  prices due to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . \n\na simple , closed , plane curve C which is a real-analytic image of the unit circle , and which is given by Afj . \nThese are real analytic periodic functions with period T . \nIn the following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares . \nThis theorem is similar to the theorem of Kakutani that there exists a circumscribing cube around any closed , bounded convex set in Afj . \nThe latter theorem has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo , and Cairns to show that in Afj there are families of such cubes . \nHere , for the case of squares inscribed in plane curves , we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other results . \nA square inscribed in a curve C means a square with its four corner points on the curve , though it may not lie entirely in the interior of C . \nIndeed , the spiral Afj , with the two endpoints connected by a straight line possesses only one inscribed square . \n\nOslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . \nThis has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . \nIn Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems . \nThis atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the  colonialist  powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . \nThe nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . \nExplosion avoided In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . \nThe general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council . \nThere should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members ' votes , since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance . \n"}

;  Seeing The Moon Rise  is dated August , 1927 . \nOne might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years , some changes in style and method would have occurred , some development taken place . \nThis is not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense . \nIn a time when poetic style , and poetic belief as well , seem in a state of continual flux , Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency . \n\nit was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies . \nIt was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies , and with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other . \n5 . \nPoland frontiers . \nWhen the Yalta Conference opened , the American policy of postponing all discussion of Russia's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down . \nStarting in great force late in December , from a line stretching from East Prussia to Budapest , the Red armies had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the Oder , thirty miles from Berlin , and the Upper Danube region was being rapidly overrun , while the Western Allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine . \nThe long delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia's advantage . \nThe West was now glad to propose the 1919 Curzon Line , which was substantially Russia's 1941 border , as the boundary between Russia and Poland . \n\nA gyro-stabilized platform system , using restrained gyros , is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the gyro-platform-servo combination . \nThe restrained gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion , neglecting transient effects , as follows : Afj where U is a torque applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro . \nThe platform angle \\*\\* yf is the angle about which the gyro is controlling . \nThis is normally termed the gyro input axis , 90-degrees away from the gyro output or \\*\\* yj axis . \nThe gyro angular momentum is defined by H . \nThus if the gyro and platform-controller combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the \\*\\* yf axis , the system can be rotated with an angular velocity Afj if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis Afj . \nIt is assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical torquers so that a torque can be applied about their output axes . \nIn the system shown in Fig. 7-1 , the accelerometer output is amplified and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro output-axis torquer . \n\nThe many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc . \n. \nA significant reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly inflected language such as Russian . \nFor English the reduction in size is less striking . \nThis approach requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word . \nThe logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file . \n\nthe eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture . \nThrough 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . \nTo reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . \nIn certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . \nThese areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . \nThe accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . \nThe process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion . \nIt was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint . \n\nthe hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week . \nFor many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous . \nIt was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ; ; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell . \nInvestors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many . \nIn fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares . \nSome Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers . \n\nWashington on President-elect John F. Kennedy's Convair , the Caroline , winged Actor-Crooner Frank Sinatra and his close Hollywood pal , Cinemactor Peter Lawford , Jack Kennedy's brother-in-law . \nAlso included in the entourage : a dog in a black sweater , Frankie and Peter had an urgent mission : to stage a mammoth Inauguration Eve entertainment gala in the capital's National Guard Armory . \nFrankie was fairly glutted with ideas , as he had hinted upon his arrival :  It's really tremendous when you think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia . \nI could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans  ! ! \nAs the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory's $ 100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $ 10,000 each . \nThe biggest single act would doubtless be staged by Frankie himself : his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by Hollywood Couturier Don Loper , who regularly makes up ladies ' ensembles . \n"}

Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4 . \n\nSome of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . \nFirst , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . \nIn contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls . \nThe Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . \nSecond , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . \nAlthough the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . \n\nThere are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts . \nThis may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both . \nThe differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . \n( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . \n) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison . \nThe greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used . \nThese differences in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between illiterate informants and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area , but that Hoijer's vocabulary is based on Swadesh's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined . \nSwadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal ; ; I , one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley . \n\nSanta Barbara --  The present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn  , Beryl W. Sprinkel , economist of Harris Trust & Savings Bank , Chicago , predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn. , California group , conference . \nAnother speaker , William H. Draper , Jr. , former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper , Gaither & Anderson , urged the U.S. to  throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we wo n't be pushed around any more  . \nHe urged support for President Kennedy's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations . \n' not flash in pan ' Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a  temporary flash in the pan  but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern . \n In view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial  he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but  there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960  . \nThesis refuted Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism  is based on very limited and questionable evidence  . \nRather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth  , he said  it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery  . \n\na few years , foamed plastics materials have managed to grow into an integral , and important , phase of the plastics industry -- and the end is still not yet in sight . \nUrethane foam , as only one example , was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955 . \nYet last year's volume probably topped 100 million lb. and expectations are for a market of 275 million lb. by 1964 . \nMany of the other foamed plastics , particularly the styrenes , show similar growth potential . \nAnd there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be evaluated . \nAs this issue goes to press , for example , one manufacturer has announced an epoxy foam with outstanding buoyancy and impact strength ; ; another reports that a cellular polypropylene , primarily for use in wire coating applications , is being investigated . \nOn the following pages , each of the major commercial foamed plastics is described in detail , as to properties , applications , and methods of processing . \n\nAnglo-Saxon and Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age . \nHrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at Finnsburg ( lines 1068 - 1159 ) , and improvises the tale of Beowulf's exploits in a complimentary comparison of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund ( lines 871 - 892 ) ; ; Alcinous ' court bard sings of the discovered adultery of Ares and Aphrodite ( Odyssey 8 266-366 ) , and takes up a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens on ( Odyssey 8 499-520 ) . \nNothing in all this is autobiographical : unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith , the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ; the poet of The Odyssey , reputed blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel Demodocus . \nSince none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter , there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition . \nThat such a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey , at least , is hard to deny . \nMilman Parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant Homeric poems are largely formulaic , and was led to postulate that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of Greek epic survived ; ; he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition , and assumed the slightly less likely corollary that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas . \n\nMr. Justice Black was one of the minority that rested on the Article 1 , power . \nIn this view , supported by only three members of the Court , a power denied by the specific provisions of Article 3 , was granted by the generality of Article 1 . \nIf this seems arbitrary , its effect was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally with citizens of the states -- at the expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction . \nFederal question jurisdiction For almost a hundred years we relied upon state courts ( subject to review by the Supreme Court ) for the protection of most rights arising under national law . \nThen in 1875 , apparently in response to the nationalizing influence of the Civil War , Congress first gave the lower federal courts general authority -- concurrently with state tribunals -- to decide cases involving federal-right questions . \nOne purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the Civil War amendments against state interference . \nSerious difficulty arose with the advent of Substantive Due Process . \nAn amendment , presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly freed slaves , became a  laissez-faire  limitation upon state economic policy . \n\nA Night in New Orleans  is the gayety planned by members of the Thrift Shop Committee for May 6 at Philmont Country Club . \nThe women have a reputation for giving parties that are different and are fun and this year's promises to follow in this fine tradition . \nMrs. H.J. Grinsfelder is chairman . \nThe Louisiana city is known , of course , for its fine food , good music and its colorful hospitality  and , when guests arrive at Philmont that night  , says Mrs. Grinsfelder ,  that is exactly what we expect to offer them . \nWe 've been working for weeks . \nThe prospects look great . \nWe are keeping a number of surprises under our hats . \n"}

Tims , president of the company . \nPfaff succeeds Martin Burke , who resigned . \nThe new promotion manager has been employed by the company since January , 1946 , as a commercial artist in the advertising department . \nHe is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen Elementary school , Fortier High school and Soule business college . \nFrom June , 1942 , until December , 1945 , Pfaff served in the Army Air Corps . \nWhile in the service he attended radio school at Scott Field in Belleville , Ill .. Before entering the service , Pfaff for five years did clerical work with a general merchandising and wholesale firm in New Orleans . \nHe is married to the former Audrey Knecht and has a daughter , Karol , 13 . \nThey reside at 4911 Miles Dr .. Washington -- Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan. 20 . \n\nRecent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M.D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel's impact resides in its  allegoric insight and moral metaphor  . \nJ.H. Miller's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . \nIn his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . \nThis essay seeks to make that exploration . \nDickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . \nHe knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response . \nIt is hardly accidental , therefore , that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or eccentric things with their hands . \n\nthe Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the Phillies , they wo n't be misled by the Pirates ' slower start this season . \n Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat  , Mauch said here the other day . \n The Pirates showed they could outclass the field last year . \nThey have the same men , no age problem , no injuries and they also have Vinegar Bend Mizell for the full season , along with Bobby Shantz  . \nTonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals , who gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , breaking even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball's world champions . \nThe Pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the Redbirds are 7-9 . \nChange in pitchers . \nSolly Hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher , from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio , for several reasons : 1 Broglio's 4-0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run mark against Pittsburgh a year ago ; ; 2 The desire to give Broglio as many starts as possible ; ; 3 The Redbirds ' disheartening 11-7 collapse against the Phillies Sunday . \n\nA Night in New Orleans  is the gayety planned by members of the Thrift Shop Committee for May 6 at Philmont Country Club . \nThe women have a reputation for giving parties that are different and are fun and this year's promises to follow in this fine tradition . \nMrs. H.J. Grinsfelder is chairman . \nThe Louisiana city is known , of course , for its fine food , good music and its colorful hospitality  and , when guests arrive at Philmont that night  , says Mrs. Grinsfelder ,  that is exactly what we expect to offer them . \nWe 've been working for weeks . \nThe prospects look great . \nWe are keeping a number of surprises under our hats . \n\n1 . \nIntroduction It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres . \nThe results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . \nWhen sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . \nObservations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface . \nRadio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets . \nThe observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600-degrees . \n\nHotel Escape's Bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction , the versatile  Kings 4 , Plus Two  . \nThis is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while -- a well integrated , fast moving outfit specializing in skits , vocals , comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch . \nShow spotlights the Kings -- George Worth , Bill Kay , Frank Ciciulla and Gene Wilson , flanked by Dave Grossman and Ron Stevens . \nThe Plus Two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine , and the beat is solid . \nIn the comedy division , the Kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props . \nNet result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense , part of which can be classed as pure slapstick . \nKings 4 , have rated as a popular act in Vegas and Western nightclubs . \nIf they ca n't chalk up big business here then let's stop this noise about how hip we are , and stick to our community singing , elsewhere Andy Bartha and his trio have booked into Oceania Lounge . \n\nThe following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the operands of those instructions which refer to the particular items : channel , unit , combined channel and unit , combined arm and file , unit record synchronizers , inquiry synchronizers , and alteration switches . \nThe declarative operation EQU is used to equate symbolic names to item numbers ( see page 85 ) . \nContinuation cards Certain Autocoder statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained in the operand ( columns 21 - 75 ) of a single line on the Autocoder coding sheet . \nWhen this is the case , the appropriate section of this manual will indicate that  Continuation Cards  may be used . \nThus , when specifically permitted , the operand of a given line on the Autocoder coding sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to four additional lines which immediately follow . \nThe label and operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand must begin in column 21 ; ; i.e. , it must be left-justified in the operand column of the coding sheet . \nThe operand need not extend across the entire operand column of either the header card or continuation cards but may end with the comma following any parameter . \nRemarks may appear to the right of the last parameter on each card provided they are separated from the operand by at least two blank spaces . \n\nEnrique Jorda , conductor and musical director of the San Francisco Symphony , will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in Europe before returning home to open the symphony's Golden Anniversary season , it was announced . \nThe guest assignments are scheduled for November 14 and 18 , with the Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana in Palermo and the Orchestra of Radio Cologne . \nThe season in San Francisco will open with a special Gala Concert on November 22 . \nDuring his five-month visit abroad , Jorda recently conducted the Orchestre Philharmonique De Bordeau in France , and the Santa Cecilia Orchestra in Rome . \nIn announcing Jorda's return , the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th anniversary season will start at the Sherman Clay box office on Wednesday . \nGuest performers and conductors during the coming season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing with the orchestra , including violinists Yehudi Menuhin , Isaac Stern , Ruggiero Ricci and David Abel ; ; pianists Leon Fleisher , Ruth Slenczynka and Stephen Bishop and conductor Earl Bernard Murray . \nThe Leningrad Kirov Ballet , which opened a series of performances Friday night at the Opera House , is , I think , the finest  classical  ballet company I have ever seen , and the production of the Petipa-Tschaikowsky  Sleeping Beauty  with which it began the series is incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing . \nThis work is no favorite of mine . \n\nThere are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory . \nMollusks are a case in point . \nThe shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . \nThough this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . \nThere can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . \nThe deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . \n\nA royal decree issued in 1910 , two years after the Belgian government assumed authority for the administration of the Congo , prescribed the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms . \nFurther decrees along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919 . \nIn 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the Governor-General , and the periodic compilation of these records was ordered . \nBut specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors . \nA unified set of regulations , applicable to all areas , was issued in 1929 , and a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was instituted at the same time . \nThe whole system was again reviewed and reorganized in 1933 . \nGeneral responsibility for its administration rested with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs , Service des Affaires Indigenes et de la Main-d'Oeuvre ( AIMO , Afj Direction , Afj Direction Generale , Gouvernement Generale ) . \nTribal authorities , the chiefs and their secretaries , were held responsible for maintaining the registers of indigenous persons within their territories , under the general supervision of district officials . \n"}

; second , it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared . \n\nThe plant was located west of the Battenkill and south of the location of the former electric light plant . \nThe Manchester Depot Sewer Company issued 214 shares of stock at $ 10 each for construction of a sewer in that locality , and assessments were made for its maintenance . \nIt has given considerable trouble at times and empties right into the Battenkill . \nFire District No. 1 discussed its possible purchase in 1945 , but considered it an unwise investment . \nThe sewer on Bonnet Street was constructed when there were only a few houses on the street . \nAs new homes were built they were connected so that all residences south of School Street are served by it . \n\none characteristic distinguishes Boris Godunov , it is the consistency with which every person on the stage -- including the chorus -- comes alive in the music . \nMuch of this lifelike quality results from Mussorgsky's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections . \nIn this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera ; ; such composers as Monteverdi , Lully and Purcell , with the same goal in mind , had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages . \nThrough long experimentation in his songs , Mussorgsky developed a Russian recitative as different from others as the language itself . \nGiving most of his musical continuity to the orchestra , he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence , but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words . \nThe moments of sung melody , in the usual sense , come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing , as in folk songs and liturgical chants . \nOtherwise Mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies for prolonged expressions of emotion -- Boris ' first monologue , for example . \nEven then , the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that the word comes first in importance . \n\n2 : : Some of the major functions of religion The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; ; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . \nIn societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . \nWith the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . \nNevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . \nAlthough the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . \nIf the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . \nThere are several closely related inner functions . \n\nThe Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced  no evidence  that any irregularities took place . \nThe jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election ,  deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta  for the manner in which the election was conducted . \nThe September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible  irregularities  in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr ..  Only a relative handful of such reports was received  , the jury said ,  considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city  . \nThe jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws  are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous  . \nIt recommended that Fulton legislators act  to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them  . \nThe grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said  are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments  . \nMerger proposed However , the jury said it believes  these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration  . \nThe City Purchasing Department , the jury said ,  is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies  . \n\nSen. John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws . \nOnce more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally . \nOr , in the words of Anatole France ,  The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges  . \nThe public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites . \nThe Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program . \nIn addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill . \nIt is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers ' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike . \n\nEast Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , Raymond H. Hawksley , the present city CD head , believes . \nMr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council  or anyone else locally  to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time . \nEast Providence now has no civil defense program . \nMr. Hawksley , the state's general treasurer , has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years . \nHe is not interested in being named a full-time director . \nNoting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program , Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director . \n\nthe honeybee , practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor . \nOccasionally , you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning over sods in your garden , but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all . \nThey keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt . \nI must add at once that these animals are what we call  queens  , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn . \nIt is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold weather . \nEven some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease . \n\nThe injured German veteran was a former miner , twenty-four years old , who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head . \nThis resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also . \nIn any event , the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became  psychically blind  , while at the same time , apparently , the sense of touch remained essentially intact . \nPsychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images , a condition in which , for example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence . \nThis circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever . \nThe necessary inference , as the authors themselves interpret it , would seem to be this :  ( ( 1 ) Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense of touch , as such . \n"}

Hawksley , the present city CD head , believes . \nMr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council  or anyone else locally  to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time . \nEast Providence now has no civil defense program . \nMr. Hawksley , the state's general treasurer , has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years . \nHe is not interested in being named a full-time director . \nNoting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program , Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director . \nHe expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $ 3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs . \nMr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job . \n\nEvery library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically ,  I 'm sorry , but we do n't have that book . \nThere would n't be much demand for it , I 'm afraid  . \nBehind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest . \nWhat to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles ? ? \nWhat to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ? \nMost library budgets are hopelessly inadequate . \nA startlingly high percentage do not exceed $ 500 annually , which includes the librarian's salary , and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world's richest city . \nThe plight of a small community library is proportionately worse . \n\nThe next question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational policy-makers . \nOn the whole , it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way . \nSeldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn . \nA hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for working-class youth . \nIn situations of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education . \nCampbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve western cities over the period of 1931 - 40 and found  little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence  , as judged by a panel of professional educators who studied the voting records on educational issues . \nThe few cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers , and such issues are not issues of educational policy . \n\n: talking and listening Though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week . \nHigh up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte . \nOn this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . \nIdeally , the President would like the French to agree on a  status quo ante  on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . \nTo continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . \nThe President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support . \nThe conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable . \nThrough Ladgham , Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba ; ; and one U.S. official said :  The key question now is which side picks up the phone first  . \n\nPhiladelphia , Jan. 23 -- Nick Skorich , the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles , was elevated today to head coach . \nSkorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $ 20,000 and $ 25,000 a year . \nHe succeeds Buck Shaw , who retired at the end of last season . \nThe appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw's staff -- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer . \nWilliams is a defensive coach . \nGauer works with the ends . \nChoice was expected The selection had been expected . \n\nThe bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout . \nThe pulmonary vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type 1 , , follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( figs. 8 , 22 ) . \nAnother marked difference is noted here . \nThe pulmonary artery , in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveoli , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura ( fig. 8 ) . \nThe bronchial artery , except for a small number of short branches in the hilum , contributes none of the pleural blood supply . \nIt does , as in type 1 , , supply the hilar lymph nodes , the pulmonary artery , the pulmonary vein , the bronchi , and the bronchioles -- terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole . \nNo bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were noted in this group . \n\nGreer Garson , world-famous star of stage , screen and television , will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has created a high standard in her profession . \nAs a Neiman-Marcus award winner the titian-haired Miss Garson is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion this season . \nShe will receive the 1961  Oscar  at the 24th annual Neiman-Marcus Exposition , Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel . \nThe only woman recipient , Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando Sarmi , creator of chic , beautiful women's fashions ; ; Harry Rolnick , president of the Byer-Rolnick Hat Corporation and designer of men's hats ; ; Sydney Wragge , creator of sophisticated casuals for women and Roger Vivier , designer of Christian Dior shoes Paris , France , whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized the shoe industry . \nThe silver and ebony plaques will be presented at noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus , president of Neiman-Marcus , Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas Society for Crippled Children Cerebral Palsy Treatment Center . \nThe attractive Greer Garson , who loves beautiful clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles , prefers timeless classical designs . \nOccasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for a fun piece simply because  It's unlike me  . \n\nAn analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts . \nFirst is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion . \nPreparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes . \nAll political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination . \nThe second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting . \nConsiderable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach . \n"}

Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . \n It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play  , he commented . \nBuchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . \n But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop  , he said . \nThe conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . \nThere have even been serious errors in the U.S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . \n The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries  , Buchheister told the delegates . \n\nA philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . \nBut a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . \nThe man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . \nBy force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . \nThis is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . \nIts boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking . \nThe population of the Congo is 13.5 million , divided into at least seven major  culture clusters  and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects . \n\nemotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man , in addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex . \nIn experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex , the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated . \nMoreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions . \nEven more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress . \nA previously extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges . \nIt seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo - and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism . \nIn addition , the neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky's interesting experiment on the  communication of affect  demonstrates . \nBut even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat , sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex . \n\nCity Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had  an inside track  with the city . \nEstimates of the city's loss in the $ 344,000 job have ranged as high as $ 200,000 . \nShortcuts unnoticed Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the  legitimate  bids of competing contractors . \nThe Hughes concern then took  shortcuts  on the project but got paid anyway , Hemphill said . \nThe Controller's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday : The city has sued for the full amount of the $ 172,400 performance bond covering the contract . \nThe Philadelphia Transportation Co. is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project . \n\nMany other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length . \nLaurence M. Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes , and Charles C. Carpenter's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes ( Thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults . \nFelix Kopstein states that  when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length  , but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity . \nIt is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity ; ; he was working with species of Java , so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect . \nCertain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions . \nAdditional records of slow growth have been omitted . \nIt is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves . \n\nPlainfield -- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is  Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism  . \nMitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr . \nR-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel . \nThe controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club . \nIt was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs . \nHughes said Monday ,  It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired . \nNow he's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state  . \n\nAppointment of William S. Pfaff Jr. , 41 , as promotion manager of The Times-Picayune Publishing Company was announced Saturday by John F. Tims , president of the company . \nPfaff succeeds Martin Burke , who resigned . \nThe new promotion manager has been employed by the company since January , 1946 , as a commercial artist in the advertising department . \nHe is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen Elementary school , Fortier High school and Soule business college . \nFrom June , 1942 , until December , 1945 , Pfaff served in the Army Air Corps . \nWhile in the service he attended radio school at Scott Field in Belleville , Ill ..

second month in a row , Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday . \nIt is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . \nWilliam Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $ 58,918 out of its budgeted $ 66,000 in the category , leaving only $ 7,082 for the rest of the month . \nAt the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $ 17,000 . \nBut it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . \nNo request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . \nBoard oks pact The commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners

manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach . \nPohl received the verdict without visible emotion . \nHe returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last July , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , Jack Walker , or his guard . \nStepson vindicated The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman's stepson , Vincent Hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in December , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict . \nMrs. Hengesbach was killed on Aug. 31 , 1958 . \n\nIt is not easy for the therapist to discern when , in the patient's communicating , an introject has appeared and is holding sway . \nOne learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone -- to his voice's suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , parrot-like . \nThe content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition , as if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove ; ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over and over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him . \nOne hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo-emotion , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her . \nEventually such incidents became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior -- which , as usual , went on without any accompanying words from her -- she asked , eagerly ,  Did you see Granny  ? ? \nAt first I did not know what she meant ; ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother , in their distant home-city . \n\nthe eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture . \nThrough 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . \nTo reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . \nIn certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . \nThese areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . \nThe accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . \nThe process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion . \n\nAustin , Texas -- A Texas halfback who does n't even know the team's plays , Eldon Moritz , ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three games . \nTime stands still every time Moritz , a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran , goes into the field . \nAlthough he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick -- several every Saturday , in fact -- out of football . \nMoritz does n't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl . \nThat's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries . \nHe ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington State . \nMoritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team . \n\nAnglo-Saxon and Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age . \nHrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at Finnsburg ( lines 1068 - 1159 ) , and improvises the tale of Beowulf's exploits in a complimentary comparison of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund ( lines 871 - 892 ) ; ; Alcinous ' court bard sings of the discovered adultery of Ares and Aphrodite ( Odyssey 8 266-366 ) , and takes up a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens on ( Odyssey 8 499-520 ) . \nNothing in all this is autobiographical : unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith , the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ; the poet of The Odyssey , reputed blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel Demodocus . \nSince none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter , there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition . \nThat such a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey , at least , is hard to deny . \nMilman Parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant Homeric poems are largely formulaic , and was led to postulate that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of Greek epic survived ; ; he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition , and assumed the slightly less likely corollary that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas . \nProceeding from Parry's conclusions and adopting one of his schemata , Francis P.

possibility of future development . \nThough this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . \nThere can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . \nThe deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . \nBy way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence . \nThere is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture . \n\nElburn , Ill . \n-- Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales :  We 've sold four corn pickers since

50 % above a year earlier . \n Before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20 %  , he says . \nThough the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas . \nParadoxically , the sales rise is due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm output . \nAlthough the Administration's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather , are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines . \n\nEvery library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically

tone systems than with consonants or vowels . \nNo single explanation is adequate to account for this . \nImprovement , however , is urgent , and at least three things will be needed . \nThe first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses . \nEven beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant systems , both in their general outlines and in many specific details . \nAn advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems , including some of the more unusual types . \nBy contrast , even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the over-simple distinction between register and contour languages . \nThis limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone . \n\nSome of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . \nFirst , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . \nIn contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls . \nThe Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . \nSecond , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . \nAlthough the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . \nThird , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children . \n\nA variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies . \nThese include low-temperature ethanol ( Cohn ) fractionation , electrophoresis , ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses . \nModifications of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators . \nAbelson and Rawson , using a stepwise elution scheme , fractionated whole sera containing ABO and Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose . \nSpeer and coworkers , in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera , used a series of gradients for elution from Afj . \nFahey and Morrison used a single , continuous gradient at constant pH for the fractionation of anti-A and anti-B agglutinins from preisolated \\*\\* yg-globulin samples . \nIn the present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose using single gradients similar to those described by Sober and Peterson , and certain chemical and serological properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the ABO and Rh systems have been described . \nMaterials and methods samples . \n\nSentiment . \nTension management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling . \nOne of the devices for tension management is preferential mating . \nThe preferential mating of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study . \nThe relative geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating . \nIt would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society . \nThe supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation . \n\nreasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . \nAnd this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . \nOne such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . \nHere , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . \nTwo major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . \nThe double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define  relative costs  , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . \nFor more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses . \n\nIntroduction . \nIn 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers . \nThese are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol Afj . \nThen in 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( A ) It has no complex of invariant lines , and ( B ) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1 . \nNo generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible . \n1 . \nLet Q be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli Afj and Afj , and let \\*\\* zg be a Afj curve of order K on Q . \nA general line L meets Q in two points , Afj and Afj , through each of which passes a unique generator of the regulus , Afj , whose lines are simple secants of Afj . \n\ncrucial encounter One of the initial questions put to President Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev . \nMr. Kennedy replied :  I 'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground  . \nThe President knew that a confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable . \nBut he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting . \nHe wanted to buy time to strengthen the U.S. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy . \nLast Friday the White House announced : President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4 . \nThe announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East-West relations . \n\nIt is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels . \nNo single explanation is adequate to account for this . \nImprovement , however , is urgent , and at least three things will be needed . \nThe first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses . \nEven beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant systems , both in their general outlines and in many specific details . \nAn advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems , including some of the more unusual types . \n\nVincent G.

? \nTo find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically , and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery . \nIt appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only . \nIf it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at all , that they asserted nothing true or false , but merely expressed emotions like  Hurrah  or  Fiddlesticks  , then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads could be at rest . \nThis is the course the positivists took . \nThey explained value judgments by explaining them away . \n\nLondon , Feb. 9 -- Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine , the Dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire United States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today . \nThe Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year . \nIt is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs . \nIt has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy's Nautilus , the world's first atomic submarine . \nIts power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack . \nFive held for trial The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow St. police court here at the end of a three day hearing . \nA full trial was ordered for : Two British civil servants , Miss Ethel Gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , Harry Houghton , 55 , and divorced . \n\nUnemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . \nSome vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . \nCurrent programs The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home economics . \nSince 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . \nThe George-Barden Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith Act . \nThe Health Amendment Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical nurse training . \nThe latest major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden Act . \n\n1 . \nIntroduction It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres . \nThe results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . \nWhen sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . \nObservations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface . \nRadio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets . \nThe observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600-degrees . \nThis result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence . \n\nseven months , the Garden of the Gods Club will have its gala summer opening Saturday , June 3 . \nMusic for dancing will be furnished by Allen Uhles and his orchestra , who will play each Saturday during June . \nMembers and guests will be in for an added surprise with the new wing containing 40 rooms and suites , each with its own private patio . \nGene Marshall , genial manager of the club , has announced that the Garden of the Gods will open to members Thursday , June 1 . \nBeginning July 4 , there will be an orchestra playing nightly except Sunday and Monday for the summer season . \nMrs. J. Edward Hackstaff and Mrs. Paul Luette are planning a luncheon next week in honor of Mrs. J. Clinton Bowman , who celebrates her birthday on Tuesday . \n\nthe century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law . \nSeveral factors contributed to this change . \nThe Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow . \nHere in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . \nThus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century . \nInternational law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . \nEssentially this imposed two conditions : First , international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; ; second , it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared . \n\nThe Sane Society is an ambitious work . \nIts scope is as broad as the question : What does it mean to live in modern society ? ? \nA work so broad , even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed by a moral vision , must necessarily  fail  . \nEven a hasty reader will easily find in it numerous blind spots , errors of fact and argument , important exclusions , areas of ignorance and prejudice , undue emphases on trivia , examples of broad positions supported by flimsy evidence , and the like . \nSuch books are easy prey for critics . \nNor need the critic be captious . \nA careful and orderly man , who values precision and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility , might easily be put off by such a book . \nIt is a simple matter , for one so disposed , to take a work like The Sane Society and shred it into odds and ends . \n\nthis evidence in mind , the writer began to plan how he might more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes . \nToward the end of the semester's work , he interviewed every married class member at great length . \nHe found , as he had suspected , a general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed course was not really functional for these students . \nHowever , all admitted that the  hindsight  was not altogether lost . \nIn their own words , it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they had gotten into their marriages , and perhaps they had obtained some insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time . \nIn fact , they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design a section exclusively for married students there should be , at the beginning , some  hindsight  study ; ; but they all hastened to add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent . \nAll of them felt a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course . \nA few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section for married students . \n\nsentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . \nThe tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . \nThere is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes . \nThus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley's hymns are as follows . \n A charge to keep I have , A God to glorify  . \nIn the tune to which this hymn is most often sung ,  Boylston  , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have . \nDominant stress is of course more than extended duration , and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center on its first syllable rather than its last . \n\nVincent G. Ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant district attorney , it was announced Monday by Charles E. Raymond , District Attorney . \nIerulli will replace Desmond D. Connall who has been called to active military service but is expected back on the job by March 31 . \nIerulli , 29 , has been practicing in Portland since November , 1959 . \nHe is a graduate of Portland University and the Northwestern College of Law . \nHe is married and the father of three children . \nHelping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically , E.M. Martin , assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday night . \n"}

Smith & Townsend ) on sweet clover stems . \n( 2 ) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 - 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems . \nThe proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of Afj in Afj to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80 % saturation with Afj . \nThe precipitate was washed twice with an 80 % saturated solution of Afj , dissolved in a small quantity of 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer , dialyzed against cold distilled water till free from ammonium ions , and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen . \n( 3 ) In other experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade ( 1957 ) . \n( 4 ) The conjugates were passed through a diethylaminoethyl ( DEAE ) cellulose column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer ( PBS ) containing Afj potassium phosphate and Afj . \nPreparation of frozen sections The technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that described by Coons et al ( 1951 ) . \nRoot and stem tumors from sweet clover plants infected with WTV were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen , embedded in ice , and cut at 3 - 6 \\*\\* ym in a cryostat maintained at -16-degrees to -20-degrees . \n\nit was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies . \nIt was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies , and with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other . \n5 . \nPoland frontiers . \nWhen the Yalta Conference opened , the American policy of postponing all discussion of Russia's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down . \nStarting in great force late in December , from a line stretching from East Prussia to Budapest , the Red armies had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the Oder , thirty miles from Berlin , and the Upper Danube region was being rapidly overrun , while the Western Allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine . \nThe long delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia's advantage . \nThe West was now glad to propose the 1919 Curzon Line , which was substantially Russia's 1941 border , as the boundary between Russia and Poland . \n\nbriefly , the topping configuration must be examined for its inferences . \nThen the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had further forecasting significance . \nAnd then the application of the count rules to the width ( horizontally ) of the configuration gives us an intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline . \nThe very idea of there being  count rules  implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway ( run up or run down ) movement . \nThis expectation is what really  sold  point and figure . \nBut there is no positive and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense . \nExperience will show that only the vaguest generalities apply , and in fine , these merely dwell upon a relationship between the durations and intensities of events . \nAfter all , too much does not happen too suddenly , nor does very little take long . \n\nGreer Garson , world-famous star of stage , screen and television , will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has created a high standard in her profession . \nAs a Neiman-Marcus award winner the titian-haired Miss Garson is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion this season . \nShe will receive the 1961  Oscar  at the 24th annual Neiman-Marcus Exposition , Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel . \nThe only woman recipient , Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando Sarmi , creator of chic , beautiful women's fashions ; ; Harry Rolnick , president of the Byer-Rolnick Hat Corporation and designer of men's hats ; ; Sydney Wragge , creator of sophisticated casuals for women and Roger Vivier , designer of Christian Dior shoes Paris , France , whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized the shoe industry . \nThe silver and ebony plaques will be presented at noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus , president of Neiman-Marcus , Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas Society for Crippled Children Cerebral Palsy Treatment Center . \nThe attractive Greer Garson , who loves beautiful clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles , prefers timeless classical designs . \nOccasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for a fun piece simply because  It's unlike me  . \n\nThe nation the three-front war At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad . \nAfterward , Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen . \nWhat Herter presented , said Gore , was  not a very encouraging review  . \nThat was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts . \nWhile Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . \n1 ) Cuba . \nHours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery , Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens , plus 120 Cuban employees ) . \nPresident Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately . \n\nOslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . \nThis has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . \nIn Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems . \nThis atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the  colonialist  powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . \nThe nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . \nExplosion avoided In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . \nThe general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council . \nThere should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members ' votes , since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance . \n"}

; ( 2 ) Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game ; ; ( 3 ) the Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them ; ; and ( 4 ) catcher Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter . \nPitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal . \nExperts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused by expansion . \n\ninvisible , modern revolt , like X-rays and radioactivity , is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels , where it is called delinquency . \n Disaffiliation  , by the way , is the term used by the critic and poet , Lawrence Lipton , who has written several articles on this subject , the first of which , in The Nation , quoted as Epigraph :  We disaffiliate . \n -- John L.

Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week . \nHigh up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte . \nOn this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N.

; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . \nIn societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . \nWith the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . \nNevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . \nAlthough the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . \nIf the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . \nThere are several closely related inner functions . \nIn the last analysis , religion is the means of inducing , formulating , expressing , enhancing , implementing , and perpetuating man's deepest experience -- the religious . \n\nUnemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . \nSome vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . \nCurrent programs The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home economics . \nSince 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . \nThe George-Barden Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith Act . \nThe Health Amendment Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical nurse training . \nThe latest major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden Act . \nAnnual authorizations of $ 15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians . \n\nElburn , Ill . \n-- Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales :  We 've sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have good prospects for 10 more . \nWe sold only four pickers all last year  . \nGus Ehlers , competitor of Mr. Houtz in this farm community , says his business since August 1 is running 50 % above a year earlier . \n Before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20 %  , he says . \nThough the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas . \nParadoxically , the sales rise is due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm output . \n\nAnalysis Analysis means the evaluation of subparts , the comparative ratings of parts , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements . \nAnalysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts . \nImpersonal purposes Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals . \nRoleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals . \nFor example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying . \nExamples Let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis . \nOne should keep in mind that many of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas . \nEvaluation The president of a small firm selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business . \n"}

Draper , Jr. , former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper , Gaither & Anderson , urged the U.S. to  throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we wo n't be pushed around any more  . \nHe urged support for President Kennedy's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations . \n' not flash in pan ' Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a  temporary flash in the pan  but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern . \n In view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial  he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but  there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960  . \nThesis refuted Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism  is based on very limited and questionable evidence  . \nRather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth  , he said  it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery  . \n\ninvisible , modern revolt , like X-rays and radioactivity , is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels , where it is called delinquency . \n Disaffiliation  , by the way , is the term used by the critic and poet , Lawrence Lipton , who has written several articles on this subject , the first of which , in The Nation , quoted as Epigraph :  We disaffiliate . \n -- John L.

Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates . \nAt the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable . \nSome anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years . \nThe resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders . \nSome viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party . \nOpposition reported Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary . \nThese contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr. Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city . \nTheir view is that last-minute changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as Mayor . \n\nthe three main categories of antisubmarine warfare operations are defense of shipping , defense of naval forces , and area defense . \nThe last category overlaps the others in amphibious operations and near terminals and bases . \nTo effect these operations , five elements exist ( 1 ) surface , ( 2 ) air , ( 3 ) mines , ( 4 ) submarine , and ( 5 ) fixed installations . \nSurface forces have been used to provide defense zones around naval and merchant ship formations , air to furnish area surveillance , and mines for protection of limited areas . \nSubmarines and shore installations are new elements . \nThe submarine now has a definite place in submarine defense particularly in denying enemy access to ocean areas . \nFixed installations offer possibilities for area detection . \n\nSt. Johns , Mich. , April 19 . \n-- A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach . \nPohl received the verdict without visible emotion . \nHe returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last July , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , Jack Walker , or his guard . \nStepson vindicated The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman's stepson , Vincent Hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in December , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict . \nMrs. Hengesbach was killed on Aug. 31 , 1958 . \nHengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since . \nWhen the verdict came in against his young neighbor , Hengesbach said :  I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed . \n"}

Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes , and Charles C. Carpenter's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes ( Thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults . \nFelix Kopstein states that  when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length  , but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity . \nIt is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity ; ; he was working with species of Java , so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect . \nCertain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions . \nAdditional records of slow growth have been omitted . \nIt is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves . \nThere seems to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths , starting with the smallest ( boa constrictor ) and ending with the largest ( anaconda ) . \n\nThe preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined by the sociologist . \nLike primitive numbers in mathematics , the entire axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth . \nBut what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduces the idea of physical models ? ? \nIs it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred canons in social science ? ? \nIt has become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by erecting mathematical and physical models , is itself a conditioned response to a world which pays a premium price for technological manipulation . \nThis push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word  mass  to mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals in such a group can be studied . \n( cf.

Before entering the service , Pfaff for five years did clerical work with a general merchandising and wholesale firm in New Orleans . \nHe is married to the former Audrey Knecht and has a daughter , Karol , 13 . \n\nLos Angeles in 1957 finally bowed to the skyscraper . \n) And without high density in the core , rapid-transit systems can not be maintained economically , let alone built from scratch at today's prices . \nHowever , the building of freeways and garages can not continue forever . \nThe new interchange among the four Los Angeles freeways , including the grade-constructed accesses , occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land , one-eighth of a square mile , an area about the size of Rockefeller Center in New York . \nIt is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law calls  the highest and best use  of centrally located urban land . \nAs it affects the city's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ; ; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services . \nSubways improved land values without taking away land ; ; freeways boost valuation less ( because the garages they require are not prime buildings by a long shot ) , and reduce the acreage that can be taxed . \n\nA philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . \nBut a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . \nThe man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . \nBy force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . \nThis is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . \nIts boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking . \n\nLondon , Feb. 9 -- Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine , the Dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire United States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today . \nThe Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year . \nIt is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs . \nIt has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy's Nautilus , the world's first atomic submarine . \nIts power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack . \nFive held for trial The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow St. police court here at the end of a three day hearing . \n\none explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium ( section 381 ( c ) ( 9 ) ) , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section 381 ( c ) ( 16 ) ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section 381 ( c ) ( 6 ) ) , but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company ( section 381 ( c ) ( 14 ) ) , but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes ? ? \nThese items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . \nThere does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities . \nWith respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 ( c ) , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation . \nTo this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute . \nIt is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes . \nSuch an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone ; ; it would certainly violate the intention of Congress as expressed in the Committee Report ; ; and in at least one instance , involving refund claims , it might be contrary to another provision of the United States Code . \n\nHigh-gain , photoelectronic image intensification is applied under conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time required by a sensor or recording instrument exceeds the limits of practicability . \nExamples of such situations are ( aerial ) night reconnaissance , the recording of radioactive tracers in live body tissues , special radiography in medical or industrial applications , track recording of high energy particles , etc .. High-gain photoelectronic image intensification may be achieved by several methods ; ; some of these are listed below : ( A ) Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems , ( B ) Channel-type , secondary emission image intensifier , ( C ) Image intensifier based upon the  multipactor  principle , ( D ) Transmission secondary electron multiplication image intensifiers ( TSEM tubes ) , ( E ) Cascading of single stages , enclosed in one common envelope . \nCascading single stages by coupling lens systems is rather inefficient as the lens systems limit the obtainable gain quite severely . \nChannel-type image intensifiers are capable of achieving high-gain values ; ; they suffer , however , from an inherently low resolution . \nImage intensifiers based upon the multipactor principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable resolution is concerned . \nHowever , the unavoidable low-duty cycle restricts the effective gain . \n\nthe care of five young children and concerned about persistent economic difficulties due to her husband's marginal income , her defense of denial was excessively strong . \nThus the lack of effective recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two babies showed signs of becoming a disabling problem . \nThe result , dramatically visible in a matter of days in the family's disrupted daily functioning , was a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would befall the second twin , whose birth had not been anticipated . \nSoon Mrs. B.'s fears threatened to burst into a full-blown panic concerning the welfare of the entire family . \nInability to care for the other children , difficulty in feeding the babies , who seemed colicky , bone-weary fatigue , repeated crying episodes , and short tempers reflected the family's helplessness in coping with the stressful situation . \nClearly , this was a family in crisis . \nMrs. B. compared her feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at the time of her mother's death when she was eight , as well as her subsequent anger at her father for remarrying . \nHer previous traumatic experiences flashed through her mind as if they had happened yesterday . \n\nThe plant was located west of the Battenkill and south of the location of the former electric light plant . \nThe Manchester Depot Sewer Company issued 214 shares of stock at $ 10 each for construction of a sewer in that locality , and assessments were made for its maintenance . \nIt has given considerable trouble at times and empties right into the Battenkill . \nFire District No. 1 discussed its possible purchase in 1945 , but considered it an unwise investment . \nThe sewer on Bonnet Street was constructed when there were only a few houses on the street . \nAs new homes were built they were connected so that all residences south of School Street are served by it . \nB.J. Connell is the present treasurer and manager . \nThe 1946 town meeting voted to have the Selectmen appoint a committee to investigate and report on the feasibility of some system of sewage disposal and a disposal plant to serve Manchester Center , Depot , and Way's Lane . \n\nTwo metabolites ( 1 , and 2 ) ) of p-aminobenzoic acid ( PABA ) which act as cofactors for the hydroxylation of aniline by acid-fast bacteria are biosynthesized from Afj . \nThe 7 carbons of PABA are incorporated directly into metabolite 2 ( ( as shown with both ring-labeled and carboxy-labeled Afj ) . \nThirty-five of the 36 carbon atoms arise from Afj . \nAll 28 carbons of metabolite 1 ( ( a product of mild acid hydrolysis of 2 ) arise from Afj . \nMetabolite 1 , isolated from the medium , however , showed a lower specific activity , which indicates endogenous synthesis of this metabolite . \nVigorous acid hydrolysis of metabolite 1 , destroyed the biological activity of the compound and liberated two aryl amines . \n"}

Ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant district attorney , it was announced Monday by Charles E. Raymond , District Attorney . \nIerulli will replace Desmond D. Connall who has been called to active military service but is expected back on the job by March 31 . \nIerulli , 29 , has been practicing in Portland since November , 1959 . \nHe is a graduate of Portland University and the Northwestern College of Law . \nHe is married and the father of three children . \nHelping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically , E.M. Martin , assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday night . \nMartin , who has been in office in Washington , D.C. , for 13 months spoke at the council's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel . \n\nControl of socioeconomic status It would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being investigated : the degree of structure in teaching method . \nThe structured schools were in an industrial city , with three-family tenement houses typical of the residential areas , but with one rather sizable section of middle-class homes . \nThe unstructured schools were in a large suburban community , predominantly middle - to upper-middle class , but fringed by an industrial area . \nIn order to equate the samples on socioeconomic status , we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods . \nSchool principals and guidance workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas . \nAn objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data . \n\nreasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . \nAnd this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . \nOne such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . \nHere , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . \nTwo major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . \nThe double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define  relative costs  , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . \nFor more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses . \nBy all means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs , and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution . \n\ntoll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes . \nLong-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward . \nHigher toll rates also are helping boost revenues . \nResult is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative . \nThings are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds . \nTraffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing . \n\nemotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man , in addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex . \nIn experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex , the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated . \nMoreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions . \nEven more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress . \nA previously extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges . \nIt seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo - and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism . \nIn addition , the neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky's interesting experiment on the  communication of affect  demonstrates . \nBut even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat , sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex . \n\ninvisible , modern revolt , like X-rays and radioactivity , is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels , where it is called delinquency . \n Disaffiliation  , by the way , is the term used by the critic and poet , Lawrence Lipton , who has written several articles on this subject , the first of which , in The Nation , quoted as Epigraph :  We disaffiliate . \n -- John L. Lewis . \nLike the pillars of Hercules , like two ruined Titans guarding the entrance to one of Dante's circles , stand two great dead juvenile delinquents -- the heroes of the post-war generation : the great saxophonist , Charlie Parker , and Dylan Thomas . \nIf the word deliberate means anything , both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves . \nBoth of them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves , because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical art . \nBoth of them were my friends . \nLiving in San Francisco I saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted by exasperation or fatigue . \n\nThe many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc . \n. \nA significant reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly inflected language such as Russian . \nFor English the reduction in size is less striking . \nThis approach requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word . \nThe logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file . \nImplementation of the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis . \nWe suggest the application of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem . \n\nA variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies . \nThese include low-temperature ethanol ( Cohn ) fractionation , electrophoresis , ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses . \nModifications of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators . \nAbelson and Rawson , using a stepwise elution scheme , fractionated whole sera containing ABO and Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose . \nSpeer and coworkers , in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera , used a series of gradients for elution from Afj . \nFahey and Morrison used a single , continuous gradient at constant pH for the fractionation of anti-A and anti-B agglutinins from preisolated \\*\\* yg-globulin samples . \nIn the present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose using single gradients similar to those described by Sober and Peterson , and certain chemical and serological properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the ABO and Rh systems have been described . \n\nthese remarks , like most criticisms of Hardy , have tacitly assumed that his poetry is all of a piece , one solid mass of verse expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development . \nFor critics , Hardy has had no poetic periods -- one does not speak of early Hardy or late Hardy , or of the London or Max Gate period , but simply of Hardy , as of a poetic monolith . \nThis seems odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet :  Domicilium  is dated  between 1857 and 1860  ; ;  Seeing The Moon Rise  is dated August , 1927 . \nOne might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years , some changes in style and method would have occurred , some development taken place . \nThis is not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense . \nIn a time when poetic style , and poetic belief as well , seem in a state of continual flux , Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency . \nThough he struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties ; ; the  sober opinion  of his letter to Noyes , written when Hardy was eighty years old , is essentially that of his first  philosophical  notebook entry , made when he was twenty-five :  The world does not despise us : it only neglects us  ( Early Life , p. 63 ) . \nAnd though in his later years he revised his poems many times , the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty ; ; so that , while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy , it is difficult to date one . \n\nHigh-gain , photoelectronic image intensification is applied under conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time required by a sensor or recording instrument exceeds the limits of practicability . \nExamples of such situations are ( aerial ) night reconnaissance , the recording of radioactive tracers in live body tissues , special radiography in medical or industrial applications , track recording of high energy particles , etc .. High-gain photoelectronic image intensification may be achieved by several methods ; ; some of these are listed below : ( A ) Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems , ( B ) Channel-type , secondary emission image intensifier , ( C ) Image intensifier based upon the  multipactor  principle , ( D ) Transmission secondary electron multiplication image intensifiers ( TSEM tubes ) , ( E ) Cascading of single stages , enclosed in one common envelope . \nCascading single stages by coupling lens systems is rather inefficient as the lens systems limit the obtainable gain quite severely . \nChannel-type image intensifiers are capable of achieving high-gain values ; ; they suffer , however , from an inherently low resolution . \nImage intensifiers based upon the multipactor principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable resolution is concerned . \nHowever , the unavoidable low-duty cycle restricts the effective gain . \nTSEM tubes have been constructed showing high gain and resolution . \n"}

? \nAt first I did not know what she meant ; ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother , in their distant home-city . \nThen I realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; ; and when I replied in this spirit , she corroborated my hunch . \nAt another phase in the therapy , when a pathogenic mother-introject began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene , she muttered in a low but intense voice , to herself ,  I hate that woman inside me  ! ! \n\nA band viscometer is shown in Figure 2 . \nIt consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims . \nThere is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed . \nA tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks . \nIn normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks . \nAfter it has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded . \n\nThere are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory . \nMollusks are a case in point . \nThe shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . \nThough this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . \nThere can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . \nThe deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . \n\nit is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief  structuring  experience . \nIt was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal , concretistic reports of what the ambiguous figure  looked like  as reflecting their hesitancy about taking chances . \nThis was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action . \nResponses such as  rope with a loop in it  , and  two pieces of rope  , were quite characteristic . \nGuilford-Martin personality inventories . \nThe three personality inventories ( Guilford ; ; Guilford-Martin ; ; Guilford-Martin ) were filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects . \nThese were the same subjects who were given the Rorschach test . \nSome predictions had been made concerning factors R , N , I and Co on these inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security aspects of personality functioning which were hypothesized as being of importance in differential Kohnstamm reactivity . \n\nEmory University's Board of Trustees announced Friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state's tax laws made such a step possible . \n Emory University's charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race  , board chairman Henry L. Bowden stated . \nBut an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes . \nThe statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated . \n Emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions  , the statement said . \nThe statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation . \nAn Emory spokesman indicated , however , that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws . \n\nEmory University's Board of Trustees announced Friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state's tax laws made such a step possible . \n Emory University's charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race  , board chairman Henry L.

Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes , and Charles C. Carpenter's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes ( Thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults . \nFelix Kopstein states that  when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length  , but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity . \nIt is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity ; ; he was working with species of Java , so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect . \nCertain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions . \nAdditional records of slow growth have been omitted . \nIt is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves . \n\nEnrique Jorda , conductor and musical director of the San Francisco Symphony , will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in Europe before returning home to open the symphony's Golden Anniversary season , it was announced . \nThe guest assignments are scheduled for November 14 and 18 , with the Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana in Palermo and the Orchestra of Radio Cologne . \nThe season in San Francisco will open with a special Gala Concert on November 22 . \nDuring his five-month visit abroad , Jorda recently conducted the Orchestre Philharmonique De Bordeau in France , and the Santa Cecilia Orchestra in Rome . \nIn announcing Jorda's return , the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th anniversary season will start at the Sherman Clay box office on Wednesday . \nGuest performers and conductors during the coming season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing with the orchestra , including violinists Yehudi Menuhin , Isaac Stern , Ruggiero Ricci and David Abel ; ; pianists Leon Fleisher , Ruth Slenczynka and Stephen Bishop and conductor Earl Bernard Murray . \nThe Leningrad Kirov Ballet , which opened a series of performances Friday night at the Opera House , is , I think , the finest  classical  ballet company I have ever seen , and the production of the Petipa-Tschaikowsky  Sleeping Beauty  with which it began the series is incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing . \n"}

; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . \nIn societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . \nWith the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . \nNevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . \nAlthough the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . \nIf the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . \nThere are several closely related inner functions . \nIn the last analysis , religion is the means of inducing , formulating , expressing , enhancing , implementing , and perpetuating man's deepest experience -- the religious . \n\nreasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . \nAnd this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . \nOne such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . \nHere , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . \nTwo major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . \nThe double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define  relative costs  , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . \n\nUnemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . \nSome vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . \nCurrent programs The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home economics . \nSince 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . \nThe George-Barden Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith Act . \nThe Health Amendment Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical nurse training . \nThe latest major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden Act . \n\n6.4 . \nThe primary decomposition theorem We are trying to study a linear operator T on the finite-dimensional space V , by decomposing T into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense elementary . \nWe can do this through the characteristic values and vectors of T in certain special cases , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial for T factors over the scalar field F into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1 . \nWhat can we do with the general T ? ? \nIf we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems . \nFirst , T may not have a single characteristic value ; ; this is really a deficiency in the scalar field , namely , that it is not algebraically closed . \n\ncrucial encounter One of the initial questions put to President Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev . \nMr. Kennedy replied :  I 'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground  . \nThe President knew that a confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable . \nBut he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting . \nHe wanted to buy time to strengthen the U.S. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy . \nLast Friday the White House announced : President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4 . \nThe announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East-West relations . \n\nSalem ( special ) -- For a second month in a row , Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday . \nIt is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . \nWilliam Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $ 58,918 out of its budgeted $ 66,000 in the category , leaving only $ 7,082 for the rest of the month . \nAt the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $ 17,000 . \nBut it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . \nNo request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . \nBoard oks pact The commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , Roy Webster , of Hood River , and Dr. Ennis Keizer , of North Bend , approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past . \n\nIntroduction . \nIn 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers . \nThese are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol Afj . \nThen in 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( A ) It has no complex of invariant lines , and ( B ) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1 . \nNo generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible . \n1 . \n"}

Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is  Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism  . \nMitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr . \nR-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel . \nThe controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club . \nIt was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs . \nHughes said Monday ,  It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired . \nNow he's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state  . \n\nthese remarks , like most criticisms of Hardy , have tacitly assumed that his poetry is all of a piece , one solid mass of verse expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development . \nFor critics , Hardy has had no poetic periods -- one does not speak of early Hardy or late Hardy , or of the London or Max Gate period , but simply of Hardy , as of a poetic monolith . \nThis seems odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet :  Domicilium  is dated  between 1857 and 1860  ; ;  Seeing The Moon Rise  is dated August , 1927 . \nOne might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years , some changes in style and method would have occurred , some development taken place . \nThis is not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense . \nIn a time when poetic style , and poetic belief as well , seem in a state of continual flux , Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency . \nThough he struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties ; ; the  sober opinion  of his letter to Noyes , written when Hardy was eighty years old , is essentially that of his first  philosophical  notebook entry , made when he was twenty-five :  The world does not despise us : it only neglects us  ( Early Life , p. 63 ) . \n\nCity Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had  an inside track  with the city . \nEstimates of the city's loss in the $ 344,000 job have ranged as high as $ 200,000 . \nShortcuts unnoticed Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the  legitimate  bids of competing contractors . \nThe Hughes concern then took  shortcuts  on the project but got paid anyway , Hemphill said . \nThe Controller's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday : The city has sued for the full amount of the $ 172,400 performance bond covering the contract . \nThe Philadelphia Transportation Co. is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project . \nThe signature of Harold V. Varani , former director of architecture and engineering in the Department of Public Property , appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project . \n\nartists , indeed , turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . \nTo speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . \nAt the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . \nTheir world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . \nAnd perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . \nThe storms of the past had died away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men's minds . \nThroughout the work of the later ninth century a calm , severe serenity displays itself . \nIn the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel one in its internal self-satisfaction , but the best of the Geometric pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the Greek world . \n\nThe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.M. next Saturday . \nThe current monthly payroll comes to about $ 15,000,000 . \nHoward E. Simpson , the railroad's president , said ,  A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action  . \nThe reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates . \nSalary cut and lay-offs It will be accomplished in two ways : 1 A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions . \nThere are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class . \n2 Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense . \n\nTwo metabolites ( 1 , and 2 ) ) of p-aminobenzoic acid ( PABA ) which act as cofactors for the hydroxylation of aniline by acid-fast bacteria are biosynthesized from Afj . \nThe 7 carbons of PABA are incorporated directly into metabolite 2 ( ( as shown with both ring-labeled and carboxy-labeled Afj ) . \nThirty-five of the 36 carbon atoms arise from Afj . \nAll 28 carbons of metabolite 1 ( ( a product of mild acid hydrolysis of 2 ) arise from Afj . \nMetabolite 1 , isolated from the medium , however , showed a lower specific activity , which indicates endogenous synthesis of this metabolite . \nVigorous acid hydrolysis of metabolite 1 , destroyed the biological activity of the compound and liberated two aryl amines . \n\nSalem ( special ) -- For a second month in a row , Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday . \nIt is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . \nWilliam Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $ 58,918 out of its budgeted $ 66,000 in the category , leaving only $ 7,082 for the rest of the month . \nAt the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $ 17,000 . \nBut it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . \nNo request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . \nBoard oks pact The commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , Roy Webster , of Hood River , and Dr. Ennis Keizer , of North Bend , approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past . \n\nthe three main categories of antisubmarine warfare operations are defense of shipping , defense of naval forces , and area defense . \nThe last category overlaps the others in amphibious operations and near terminals and bases . \nTo effect these operations , five elements exist ( 1 ) surface , ( 2 ) air , ( 3 ) mines , ( 4 ) submarine , and ( 5 ) fixed installations . \nSurface forces have been used to provide defense zones around naval and merchant ship formations , air to furnish area surveillance , and mines for protection of limited areas . \nSubmarines and shore installations are new elements . \nThe submarine now has a definite place in submarine defense particularly in denying enemy access to ocean areas . \nFixed installations offer possibilities for area detection . \nMine warfare is being reoriented against submarine targets . \n\nTwo metabolites ( 1 , and 2 ) ) of p-aminobenzoic acid ( PABA ) which act as cofactors for the hydroxylation of aniline by acid-fast bacteria are biosynthesized from Afj . \nThe 7 carbons of PABA are incorporated directly into metabolite 2 ( ( as shown with both ring-labeled and carboxy-labeled Afj ) . \nThirty-five of the 36 carbon atoms arise from Afj . \nAll 28 carbons of metabolite 1 ( ( a product of mild acid hydrolysis of 2 ) arise from Afj . \nMetabolite 1 , isolated from the medium , however , showed a lower specific activity , which indicates endogenous synthesis of this metabolite . \nVigorous acid hydrolysis of metabolite 1 , destroyed the biological activity of the compound and liberated two aryl amines . \n"}

roles as educational policy-makers . \nOn the whole , it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way . \nSeldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn . \nA hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for working-class youth . \nIn situations of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education . \nCampbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve western cities over the period of 1931 - 40 and found  little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence  , as judged by a panel of professional educators who studied the voting records on educational issues . \nThe few cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers , and such issues are not issues of educational policy . \nIn general , it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy , and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class values , which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society . \n\nAn analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts . \nFirst is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion . \nPreparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes . \nAll political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination . \nThe second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting . \nConsiderable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach . \nHowever , the regionally differentiated results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances . \n\nThe set of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy . \nAn optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product . \nThere are thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The specification of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired . \nFor a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream . \nFor the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter . \nThe objective function is some measure

of stages with no feedback was first isolated by Bellman . \n\nLondon , Feb. 9 -- Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine , the Dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire United States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today . \nThe Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year . \nIt is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs . \nIt has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy's Nautilus , the world's first atomic submarine . \nIts power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack . \nFive held for trial The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow St. police court here at the end of a three day hearing . \nA full trial was ordered for : Two British civil servants , Miss Ethel Gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , Harry Houghton , 55 , and divorced . \n\nThe Poynting-Robertson effect ( Robertson , 1937 ; ; Wyatt and Whipple , 1950 ) , which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging solar radiation , causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth . \nThe radial velocity varies inversely as the particle size -- a 1000-m-diameter particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years . \nWhipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag . \nFurther , the corpuscular radiation , i.e. , the solar-wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force . \nThe Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi-major axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun . \nAlso , planetary gravitational attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached . \nAt one astronomical unit from the sun ( the Earth's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular . \nIf such is the case , the particles within a distance of about Afj of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic energy less than their potential energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth . \n\nthe Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration of Independence . \nDuring the Brown trial , however , the state's most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence Daily Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associates , with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists , had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal governments . \nThe Providence Daily Journal answered the Daily Post by stating that the raid of John Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that  He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican Party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states  . \nThe two major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history . \nWhile the Daily Post continued to accuse Republicans and the Daily Journal continued to accuse Democrats , the Woonsocket Patriot complained that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn Brown and his men . \nEditor Foss stated ,  Of their guilt there can be no doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial  . \n\nSalem ( special ) -- For a second month in a row , Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday . \nIt is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . \nWilliam Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $ 58,918 out of its budgeted $ 66,000 in the category , leaving only $ 7,082 for the rest of the month . \nAt the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $ 17,000 . \nBut it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . \nNo request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . \n\nthe Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration of Independence . \nDuring the Brown trial , however , the state's most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence Daily Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associates , with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists ,

\n\nBiological warfare Biological warfare is the intentional use of living microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying or reducing the military effectiveness of man . \nIt is the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development , resulting in the production of BW weapons systems . \nMan may also be injured secondarily by damage to his food crops or domestic animals . \nBiological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon . \nThe major reason for this is that it has no quick-kill effect . \nThe incubation period of infectious disease , plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect , render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter . \nA man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period of most infectious diseases . \nThus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities . \n\nPolyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited . \nThe market today for detergent builders is quite diverse . \nThe best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . \nThese widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50 % by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate . \nIn the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; ; and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised . \nA well-publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder ratio . \nHard-surface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products : ( 1 ) the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork .

Miller's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . \nIn his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . \nThis essay seeks to make that exploration . \nDickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . \nHe knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response . \nIt is hardly accidental , therefore , that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or eccentric things with their hands . \nIn Great Expectations the hands become almost an obsession . \n\nSome of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . \nFirst , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . \nIn contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls . \nThe Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . \nSecond , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . \nAlthough the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . \nThird , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children . \n\none explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium ( section 381 ( c ) ( 9 ) ) , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section 381 ( c ) ( 16 ) ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section 381 ( c ) ( 6 ) ) , but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company ( section 381 ( c ) ( 14 ) ) , but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes ? ? \nThese items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . \nThere does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities . \nWith respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 ( c ) , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation . \nTo this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute . \nIt is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes . \nSuch an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone ; ; it would certainly violate the intention of Congress as expressed in the Committee Report ; ; and in at least one instance , involving refund claims , it might be contrary to another provision of the United States Code . \n\n9 . \nMartin and Stendler present evidence that infants and young children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual level simply by combining objects and counting them . \nAfter they have developed concepts , they are free from the necessity of manipulating objects ; ; they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely . \nThe ability to think seems to increase consistently with age . \nOne experiment showed the greatest one-year difference occurring between the eleventh and twelfth years . \n10 . \n\nreasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . \nAnd this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . \nOne such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . \nHere , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . \nTwo major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . \nThe double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define  relative costs  , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . \n\nAsilomar , March 26 Vast spraying programs conducted by  technicians with narrow training and little wisdom  are endangering crops and wildlife , Carl W. Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . \n It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play  , he commented . \nBuchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . \n But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop  , he said . \nThe conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . \nThere have even been serious errors in the U.S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . \n\nSen. John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws . \nOnce more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally . \nOr , in the words of Anatole France ,  The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges  . \nThe public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites . \nThe Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program . \nIn addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill . \n\nThe set of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy . \nAn optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product . \nThere are thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The specification of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired . \nFor a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream . \nFor the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter . \nThe objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ; ; it is the subject of Chapter 4 . \nThe essential characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages with no feedback was first isolated by Bellman . \nHe recognized that whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an R-stage process , the remaining stages must use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage , if there is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process . \n\nUnemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . \nSome vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . \nCurrent programs The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home economics . \nSince 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . \nThe George-Barden Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith Act . \nThe Health Amendment Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical nurse training . \nThe latest major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden Act . \nAnnual authorizations of $ 15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians . \n"}

Lewis . \nLike the pillars of Hercules , like two ruined Titans guarding the entrance to one of Dante's circles , stand two great dead juvenile delinquents -- the heroes of the post-war generation : the great saxophonist , Charlie Parker , and Dylan Thomas . \nIf the word deliberate means anything , both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves . \nBoth of them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves , because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical art . \n\nLos Angeles in 1957 finally bowed to the skyscraper . \n) And without high density in the core , rapid-transit systems can not be maintained economically , let alone built from scratch at today's prices . \nHowever , the building of freeways and garages can not continue forever . \nThe new interchange among the four Los Angeles freeways , including the grade-constructed accesses , occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land , one-eighth of a square mile , an area about the size of Rockefeller Center in New York . \nIt is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law calls  the highest and best use  of centrally located urban land . \nAs it affects the city's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ;

;  Seeing The Moon Rise  is dated August , 1927 . \nOne might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years , some changes in style and method would have occurred , some development taken place . \nThis is not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense . \nIn a time when poetic style , and poetic belief as well , seem in a state of continual flux , Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency . \nThough he struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties ; ; the  sober opinion  of his letter to Noyes , written when Hardy was eighty years old , is essentially that of his first  philosophical  notebook entry , made when he was twenty-five :  The world does not despise us : it only neglects us  ( Early Life , p. 63 ) . \n\nResentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R.

David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws . \nOnce more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally . \nOr , in the words of Anatole France ,  The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges  . \nThe public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites . \nThe Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program . \nIn addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill . \n\nA gyro-stabilized platform system , using restrained gyros , is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the gyro-platform-servo combination . \nThe restrained gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion , neglecting transient effects , as follows : Afj where U is a torque applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro . \nThe platform angle \\*\\* yf is the angle about which the gyro is controlling . \nThis is normally termed the gyro input axis , 90-degrees away from the gyro output or \\*\\* yj axis . \nThe gyro angular momentum is defined by H . \nThus if the gyro and platform-controller combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the \\*\\* yf axis , the system can be rotated with an angular velocity Afj if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis Afj . \nIt is assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical torquers so that a torque can be applied about their output axes . \n\nsentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . \nThe tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . \nThere is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes . \nThus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley's hymns are as follows . \n A charge to keep I have , A God to glorify  . \nIn the tune to which this hymn is most often sung ,  Boylston  , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have . \n\nThere are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory . \nMollusks are a case in point . \nThe shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . \nThough this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . \nThere can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . \nThe deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . \nBy way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence . \n\nThe following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the operands of those instructions which refer to the particular items : channel , unit , combined channel and unit , combined arm and file , unit record synchronizers , inquiry synchronizers , and alteration switches . \nThe declarative operation EQU is used to equate symbolic names to item numbers ( see page 85 ) . \nContinuation cards Certain Autocoder statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained in the operand ( columns 21 - 75 ) of a single line on the Autocoder coding sheet . \nWhen this is the case , the appropriate section of this manual will indicate that  Continuation Cards  may be used . \nThus , when specifically permitted , the operand of a given line on the Autocoder coding sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to four additional lines which immediately follow . \nThe label and operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand must begin in column 21 ;

; Guilford-Martin ; ; Guilford-Martin ) were filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects . \n"}

Rapoport , 1959 : : Ch. 11 . \n) Here I think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent . \n\nThe Poynting-Robertson effect ( Robertson , 1937 ; ; Wyatt and Whipple , 1950 ) , which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging solar radiation , causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth . \nThe radial velocity varies inversely as the particle size -- a 1000-m-diameter particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years . \nWhipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag . \nFurther , the corpuscular radiation , i.e. , the solar-wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force . \nThe Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi-major axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun . \nAlso , planetary gravitational attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached . \nAt one astronomical unit from the sun ( the Earth's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular . \n\n1 . \nIntroduction It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres . \nThe results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . \nWhen sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . \nObservations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface . \nRadio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets . \nThe observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600-degrees . \n\nThere are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts . \nThis may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both . \nThe differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . \n( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . \n) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison . \nThe greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used . \nThese differences in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between illiterate informants and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area , but that Hoijer's vocabulary is based on Swadesh's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined . \nSwadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal ; ; I , one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley . \n\nreasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . \nAnd this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . \nOne such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . \nHere , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . \nTwo major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . \nThe double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define  relative costs  , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . \nFor more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses . \n\nTemperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85 - 90-degrees-F ( 29 - 32-degrees-C ) . \nThe top rolls are loaded with 40 lbs ..

Walter , at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of Bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure . \nAfter many years and many interruptions he was able to finish the canopy fresco , and slightly less than half the frieze , beginning with the Liberty group opposite the East door , and ending with William Penn , all but one leg , when a tragic accident ended his career . \n\nthis evidence in mind , the writer began to plan how he might more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes . \nToward the end of the semester's work , he interviewed every married class member at great length . \nHe found , as he had suspected , a general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed course was not really functional for these students . \nHowever , all admitted that the  hindsight  was not altogether lost . \nIn their own words , it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they had gotten into their marriages , and perhaps they had obtained some insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time . \nIn fact , they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design a section exclusively for married students there should be , at the beginning , some  hindsight  study ; ; but they all hastened to add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent . \nAll of them felt a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course . \n\none explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium ( section 381 ( c ) ( 9 ) ) , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section 381 ( c ) ( 16 ) ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section 381 ( c ) ( 6 ) ) , but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company ( section 381 ( c ) ( 14 ) ) , but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes ? ? \nThese items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . \nThere does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities . \nWith respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 ( c ) , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation . \nTo this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute . \nIt is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes . \n\nAppointment of William S. Pfaff Jr. , 41 , as promotion manager of The Times-Picayune Publishing Company was announced Saturday by John F.

; and ( 4 ) catcher Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter . \nPitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal . \n\nA proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline Afj as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented . \nAfj is paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening . \nThe lines are asymmetric and over the range of field Afj gauss and temperature Afj the asymmetry increases with increasing Afj and decreasing T . \nAn isotropic resonance shift of Afj to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction . \nThe general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment Afj of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized to Afj . \nThe theory predicts a linear dependence of Afj on Afj , where J is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss constant . \nThe experimental second moment Afj conforms to the relation Afj in agreement with theory . \nHence , the electron paramagnetic effects ( slope ) can be separated from the nuclear effects ( intercept ) . \n\nsentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . \nThe tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . \nThere is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes . \nThus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley's hymns are as follows . \n A charge to keep I have , A God to glorify  . \nIn the tune to which this hymn is most often sung ,  Boylston  , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have . \n\nindividual classes of foods differ in their requirements for preservation , a number of methods have been developed over the years involving one or a combination of procedures such as dehydration , fermentation , salting , chemical treatment , canning , refrigeration , and freezing . \nThe basic objectives in each instance are to make available supplies of food during the intervals between harvesting or slaughter , to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and insects , and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of harvest or production to areas of consumption . \nIn earlier years , the preservation of food was essentially related to survival . \nIn the more sophisticated atmosphere of today's developed nations , food-preservation techniques have } sought also to bring variety , peak freshness , and optimum taste and flavor in foods at reasonable cost to the consumer . \nWith the development of nuclear technology , isotopic materials , and machine radiation sources in recent years , the possibilities of applying ionizing radiation to the preservation of foods attracted the attention of investigators in the United States and throughout the world . \nAn early hope that irradiation might be the ultimate answer to practically all food preservation problems was soon dispelled . \nInterest remained , however , in the possibility that it would serve as a useful supplementary method for counteracting spoilage losses and for preserving some foods at lower over-all costs than freezing , or without employing heat or chemicals with their attendant taste alterations . \nFactors responsible for the spoilage of foods The chief factors responsible for the spoilage of fresh foodstuffs are ( 1 ) microorganisms such as bacteria , molds , and yeasts , ( 2 ) enzymes , ( 3 ) insects , ( 4 ) sprouting , and ( 5 ) chemical reactions . \n\nthe eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture . \nThrough 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . \nTo reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . \nIn certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . \nThese areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . \nThe accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . \nThe process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion . \n\nOrganization : In this publication measurements of interfacial angles of crystals are used to classify and identify chemical substances . \nT.V. Barker , who developed the classification-angle system , was about to begin the systematic compilation of the index when he died in 1931 . \nThe compilation work was undertaken by a number of interested crystallographers in the Department of Mineralogy of the University Museum at Oxford . \nSince 1948 the working headquarters has been the Department of Geology and Mineralogy . \nNumerous cooperating individuals in Great Britain , Holland , the United States , and Belgium have contributed editorially or by making calculations . \nGreat interest and practical help have been given by the Barker Index Committee . \nFinancial and material help have come from academic , governmental , and industrial organizations in England and Holland . \nEditors for Volumes 1 , and 2 , were M.W. Porter and the late R.C. Spiller , both of Oxford University . \n\nemotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man , in addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex . \nIn experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex , the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated . \nMoreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions . \nEven more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress . \nA previously extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges . \nIt seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo - and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism . \n\nThe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.M. next Saturday . \nThe current monthly payroll comes to about $ 15,000,000 . \nHoward E. Simpson , the railroad's president , said ,  A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action  . \nThe reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates . \nSalary cut and lay-offs It will be accomplished in two ways : 1 A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions . \nThere are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class . \n2 Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense . \n"}

40 and found  little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence  , as judged by a panel of professional educators who studied the voting records on educational issues . \nThe few cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers , and such issues are not issues of educational policy . \nIn general , it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy , and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class values , which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society . \n\n9 . \nMartin and Stendler present evidence that infants and young children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual level simply by combining objects and counting them . \nAfter they have developed concepts , they are free from the necessity of manipulating objects ; ; they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely . \nThe ability to think seems to increase consistently with age . \nOne experiment showed the greatest one-year difference occurring between the eleventh and twelfth years . \n10 . \nMany studies indicate that elementary-school children's interests cover the whole field of science ; ; that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes and events ; ; and that as they mature their interests and capabilities change and broaden . \nEmotional characteristics How a child feels about himself , about other people , and about the tasks confronting him in school may have as much influence on his success in school as his physical and intellectual characteristics . \n"}

\nIn the following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares . \nThis theorem is similar to the theorem of Kakutani that there exists a circumscribing cube around any closed , bounded convex set in Afj . \nThe latter theorem has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo , and Cairns to show that in Afj there are families of such cubes . \nHere , for the case of squares inscribed in plane curves , we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other results . \nA square inscribed in a curve C means a square with its four corner points on the curve , though it may not lie entirely in the interior of C . \n\nBiological warfare Biological warfare is the intentional use of living microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying or reducing the military effectiveness of man . \nIt is the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development , resulting in the production of BW weapons systems . \nMan may also be injured secondarily by damage to his food crops or domestic animals . \nBiological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon . \nThe major reason for this is that it has no quick-kill effect . \nThe incubation period of infectious disease , plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect , render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter . \nA man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period of most infectious diseases . \nThus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities . \n\nSome of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . \nFirst , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . \nIn contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls . \nThe Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . \nSecond , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . \nAlthough the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . \nThird , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children . \n\nSentiment . \nTension management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling . \nOne of the devices for tension management is preferential mating . \nThe preferential mating of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study . \nThe relative geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating . \nIt would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society . \n\nartists , indeed , turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . \nTo speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . \nAt the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . \nTheir world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . \nAnd perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . \nThe storms of the past had died away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men's minds . \nThroughout the work of the later ninth century a calm , severe serenity displays itself . \n\nAbstract Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) . \nThus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . \nIt was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy . \nA detailed energy balance of the anode was established . \nThe anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount . \nThe dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Afj . \nQualitative observations were made and high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities . \nIntroduction The high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation . \n\nMr. Justice Black was one of the minority that rested on the Article 1 , power . \nIn this view , supported by only three members of the Court , a power denied by the specific provisions of Article 3 , was granted by the generality of Article 1 . \nIf this seems arbitrary , its effect was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally with citizens of the states -- at the expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction . \nFederal question jurisdiction For almost a hundred years we relied upon state courts ( subject to review by the Supreme Court ) for the protection of most rights arising under national law . \nThen in 1875 , apparently in response to the nationalizing influence of the Civil War , Congress first gave the lower federal courts general authority -- concurrently with state tribunals -- to decide cases involving federal-right questions . \nOne purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the Civil War amendments against state interference . \nSerious difficulty arose with the advent of Substantive Due Process . \nAn amendment , presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly freed slaves , became a  laissez-faire  limitation upon state economic policy . \n"}

Only a relative handful of such reports was received  , the jury said ,  considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city  . \nThe jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws  are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous  . \nIt recommended that Fulton legislators act  to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them  . \nThe grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said  are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments  . \nMerger proposed However , the jury said it believes  these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration  . \n\nA philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . \nBut a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . \nThe man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . \nBy force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . \nThis is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . \nIts boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking . \nThe population of the Congo is 13.5 million , divided into at least seven major  culture clusters  and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects . \nThe religions of the people include Christianity , Mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animism . \n\nA band viscometer is shown in Figure 2 . \nIt consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims . \nThere is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed . \nA tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks . \nIn normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks . \nAfter it has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded . \nBy the use of various weights , data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtained . \n\nthe Midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas . \nThe high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume . \nResearch at Fayette , Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg with loadings from 8 to 120 lb . \nSince experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds . \nRecent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer . \nTheir study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen hr . \nhp . \n\nMany other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length . \nLaurence M. Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes , and Charles C. Carpenter's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes ( Thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults . \nFelix Kopstein states that  when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length  , but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity . \nIt is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity ; ; he was working with species of Java , so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect . \nCertain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions . \nAdditional records of slow growth have been omitted . \nIt is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves . \nThere seems to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths , starting with the smallest ( boa constrictor ) and ending with the largest ( anaconda ) . \n\nThe next question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational policy-makers . \nOn the whole , it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way . \nSeldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn . \nA hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for working-class youth . \nIn situations of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education . \nCampbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve western cities over the period of 1931 - 40 and found  little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence  , as judged by a panel of professional educators who studied the voting records on educational issues . \nThe few cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers , and such issues are not issues of educational policy . \nIn general , it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy , and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class values , which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society . \n\nRomantic news concerns Mrs. Joan Monroe Armour and F.

Miller's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . \nIn his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . \nThis essay seeks to make that exploration . \nDickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . \nHe knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response . \nIt is hardly accidental , therefore , that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or eccentric things with their hands . \n\nIt is not easy for the therapist to discern when , in the patient's communicating , an introject has appeared and is holding sway . \nOne learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone -- to his voice's suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , parrot-like . \nThe content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition , as if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove ; ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over and over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him . \nOne hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo-emotion , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her . \nEventually such incidents became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior -- which , as usual , went on without any accompanying words from her -- she asked , eagerly ,  Did you see Granny  ? ? \nAt first I did not know what she meant ; ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother , in their distant home-city . \n\n: talking and listening Though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week . \nHigh up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte . \nOn this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . \nIdeally , the President would like the French to agree on a  status quo ante  on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . \nTo continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . \nThe President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support . \nThe conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable . \nThrough Ladgham , Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba ; ; and one U.S. official said :  The key question now is which side picks up the phone first  . \n\nUnemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . \nSome vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . \nCurrent programs The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home economics . \nSince 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . \nThe George-Barden Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith Act . \nThe Health Amendment Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical nurse training . \nThe latest major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden Act . \n\nSalem ( special ) -- For a second month in a row , Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday . \nIt is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . \nWilliam Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $ 58,918 out of its budgeted $ 66,000 in the category , leaving only $ 7,082 for the rest of the month . \nAt the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $ 17,000 . \nBut it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . \nNo request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . \nBoard oks pact The commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , Roy Webster , of Hood River , and Dr. Ennis Keizer , of North Bend , approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past . \n\nThere are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts . \nThis may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both . \nThe differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . \n( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . \n) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison . \nThe greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used . \nThese differences in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between illiterate informants and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area , but that Hoijer's vocabulary is based on Swadesh's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined . \nSwadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal ;

Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are uncommon , although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago . \nThis acquisition is a matched , perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long , plus six sidechairs and two armchairs . \nThe AID has undertaken the redecoration of the White House library as a project in connection with the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for the presidential home . \nIt is the AID's intention to create in the library  a miniature museum of Americana  before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall . \n\nThe preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined by the sociologist . \nLike primitive numbers in mathematics , the entire axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth . \nBut what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduces the idea of physical models ? ? \nIs it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred canons in social science ? ? \nIt has become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by erecting mathematical and physical models , is itself a conditioned response to a world which pays a premium price for technological manipulation . \nThis push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word  mass  to mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals in such a group can be studied . \n\nAsilomar , March 26 Vast spraying programs conducted by  technicians with narrow training and little wisdom  are endangering crops and wildlife , Carl W. Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . \n It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play  , he commented . \nBuchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . \n But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop  , he said . \nThe conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . \nThere have even been serious errors in the U.S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . \n\nreasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . \nAnd this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . \nOne such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . \nHere , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . \nTwo major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . \nThe double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define  relative costs  , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . \n"}

Magoun , Jr. , argues that Beowulf likewise was created from a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive generations , and the thesis is striking and compelling . \n\nResentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates . \nAt the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable . \nSome anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years . \nThe resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders . \nSome viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party . \nOpposition reported Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary . \nThese contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr. Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city . \n\nA . \nReasons for selecting mail questionnaire method There were two methods that could have been used for conducting the study within the resources available : ( 1 ) interviews in depth with a few selected companies , and ( 2 ) the more limited interrogation of a large number of companies by means of a mail questionnaire . \nWhile the method of interviewing a small number of companies was appealing because of the opportunity it might have furnished to probe fully the reasons and circumstances of a company's practices and opinions , it also involved the risk of paying undue attention to the unique and peculiar problems of just a few individual companies . \nAs a result , it was decided that a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more effective in determining the general practices and opinions of small firms and in highlighting some of the fundamental and recurring problems of defense procurement that concern both industry and government . \nIt was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest fruitful inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more detailed nature . \nIt is recognized that a mail questionnaire has inherent limitations . \nThere is the danger that the questions will mean different things to different respondents . \nSimple  yes  or  no  answers do not reveal the different shades of opinion that the various respondents may have . \n\nTemperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85 - 90-degrees-F ( 29 - 32-degrees-C ) . \nThe top rolls are loaded with 40 lbs .. Sixty lbs. loading is possible but 40 lbs. is adequate . \nThe suds box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain pipe ( thus returning suds to soap box ) and the machine is started . \nThe 160-ml. bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is applied slowly and directly to the running specimen . \nWashing is continued for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips or passes through the squeeze rolls . \nAt the conclusion of the washing , 8 liters of water at 90-degrees-F ( 32 \\* 0C. ) are automatically metered from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs , 4 liters to each tub . \nThis operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes . \n\nA cookie with caramel filling and chocolate frosting won $ 25,000 for a Minneapolis housewife in the 13th annual Pillsbury Bake-Off Tuesday . \nMrs. Alice H. Reese , wife of an engineer and mother of a 23-year-old son , was awarded the top prize at a luncheon in the Beverly Hilton Hotel . \nMrs. Reese entered 10 past bake-offs before she got into the finals . \nSecond grand prize of $ 5,000 went to Mrs. Clara L. Oliver for her Hawaiian coffee ring , a rich yeast bread with coconut filling and vanilla glaze . \nMother of five Mrs. Oliver is mother of five children and wife of a machinist . \nShe lives in Wellsville , Mo .. Mrs. Reese baked her cookies for only the third time in the Bake-off finals . \n\nEast Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , Raymond H. Hawksley , the present city CD head , believes . \nMr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council  or anyone else locally  to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time . \nEast Providence now has no civil defense program . \nMr. Hawksley , the state's general treasurer , has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years . \nHe is not interested in being named a full-time director . \nNoting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program , Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director . \nHe expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $ 3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs . \n\nThe following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the operands of those instructions which refer to the particular items : channel , unit , combined channel and unit , combined arm and file , unit record synchronizers , inquiry synchronizers , and alteration switches . \nThe declarative operation EQU is used to equate symbolic names to item numbers ( see page 85 ) . \nContinuation cards Certain Autocoder statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained in the operand ( columns 21 - 75 ) of a single line on the Autocoder coding sheet . \nWhen this is the case , the appropriate section of this manual will indicate that  Continuation Cards  may be used . \nThus , when specifically permitted , the operand of a given line on the Autocoder coding sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to four additional lines which immediately follow . \nThe label and operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand must begin in column 21 ; ; i.e. , it must be left-justified in the operand column of the coding sheet . \nThe operand need not extend across the entire operand column of either the header card or continuation cards but may end with the comma following any parameter . \nRemarks may appear to the right of the last parameter on each card provided they are separated from the operand by at least two blank spaces . \n\nThe thermal exchange of chlorine between Afj and liquid Afj is readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180-degrees and above . \nThe photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at 65-degrees using light absorbed only by the Afj . \nIn the gas phase , with Afj of Afj and Afj of Afj , quantum yields of the order of Afj have been observed at 85-degrees . \nDespite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure reagents , serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates of reaction . \nIt appears possible to set a lower limit of about Afj for the activation energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form Afj radical . \nThe rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions . \nIntroduction Because of the simplicity of the molecules , isotopic exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the corresponding carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data . \nIt would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free radicals , as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon-halogen bond . \n\nartists , indeed , turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . \nTo speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . \nAt the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . \nTheir world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . \nAnd perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . \nThe storms of the past had died away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men's minds . \nThroughout the work of the later ninth century a calm , severe serenity displays itself . \nIn the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel one in its internal self-satisfaction , but the best of the Geometric pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the Greek world . \n\nAbstract Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) . \nThus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . \nIt was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy . \nA detailed energy balance of the anode was established . \nThe anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount . \nThe dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Afj . \n"}

; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . \nIn societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . \nWith the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . \nNevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . \nAlthough the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . \nIf the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . \nThere are several closely related inner functions . \n\nSome of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . \nFirst , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . \nIn contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls . \nThe Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . \nSecond , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . \nAlthough the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . \nThird , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children . \nThe Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children . \n\nGreer Garson , world-famous star of stage , screen and television , will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has created a high standard in her profession . \nAs a Neiman-Marcus award winner the titian-haired Miss Garson is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion this season . \nShe will receive the 1961  Oscar  at the 24th annual Neiman-Marcus Exposition , Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel . \nThe only woman recipient , Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando Sarmi , creator of chic , beautiful women's fashions ;

Fogelson and on the go most of the time commuting from Dallas , where they maintain an apartment , to their California home in Los Angeles ' suburban Bel-Air to their ranch in Pecos , New Mexico . \n\nThere are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts . \nThis may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both . \nThe differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . \n( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . \n) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison . \nThe greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used . \nThese differences in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between illiterate informants and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area , but that Hoijer's vocabulary is based on Swadesh's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined . \nSwadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal ; ; I , one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley . \n\nthe honeybee , practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor . \nOccasionally , you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning over sods in your garden , but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all . \nThey keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt . \nI must add at once that these animals are what we call  queens  , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn . \nIt is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold weather . \nEven some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease . \nThe survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50-degrees and there is not too much wind . \n\nIt is not easy for the therapist to discern when , in the patient's communicating , an introject has appeared and is holding sway . \nOne learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone -- to his voice's suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , parrot-like . \nThe content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition , as if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove ; ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over and over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him . \nOne hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo-emotion , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her . \nEventually such incidents became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior -- which , as usual , went on without any accompanying words from her -- she asked , eagerly ,  Did you see Granny  ? ? \nAt first I did not know what she meant ; ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother , in their distant home-city . \nThen I realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; ; and when I replied in this spirit , she corroborated my hunch . \n\nAppointment of William S. Pfaff Jr. , 41 , as promotion manager of The Times-Picayune Publishing Company was announced Saturday by John F. Tims , president of the company . \nPfaff succeeds Martin Burke , who resigned . \nThe new promotion manager has been employed by the company since January , 1946 , as a commercial artist in the advertising department . \nHe is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen Elementary school , Fortier High school and Soule business college . \nFrom June , 1942 , until December , 1945 , Pfaff served in the Army Air Corps . \nWhile in the service he attended radio school at Scott Field in Belleville , Ill ..

Simpson , the railroad's president , said ,  A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action  . \nThe reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates . \nSalary cut and lay-offs It will be accomplished in two ways : 1 A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions . \nThere are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class . \n2 Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense . \n\n9 . \nMartin and Stendler present evidence that infants and young children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual level simply by combining objects and counting them . \nAfter they have developed concepts , they are free from the necessity of manipulating objects ; ; they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely . \nThe ability to think seems to increase consistently with age . \nOne experiment showed the greatest one-year difference occurring between the eleventh and twelfth years . \n10 . \nMany studies indicate that elementary-school children's interests cover the whole field of science ; ; that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes and events ; ; and that as they mature their interests and capabilities change and broaden . \n\nThe injured German veteran was a former miner , twenty-four years old , who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head . \nThis resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also . \nIn any event , the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became  psychically blind  , while at the same time , apparently , the sense of touch remained essentially intact . \nPsychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images , a condition in which , for example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence . \nThis circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever . \nThe necessary inference , as the authors themselves interpret it , would seem to be this :  ( ( 1 ) Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense of touch , as such . \nWe do not arrive at spatial images by means of the sense of touch by itself . \n\nOrganization : In this publication measurements of interfacial angles of crystals are used to classify and identify chemical substances . \nT.V.

Draper , Jr. , former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper , Gaither & Anderson , urged the U.S. to  throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we wo n't be pushed around any more  . \nHe urged support for President Kennedy's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations . \n' not flash in pan ' Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a  temporary flash in the pan  but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern . \n In view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial  he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but  there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960  . \nThesis refuted Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism  is based on very limited and questionable evidence  . \n\nResentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates . \nAt the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable . \nSome anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years . \nThe resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders . \nSome viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party . \nOpposition reported Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary . \nThese contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr. Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city . \n\nAn analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts . \nFirst is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion . \nPreparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes . \nAll political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination . \nThe second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting . \nConsiderable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach . \n\nElburn , Ill . \n-- Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales :  We 've sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have good prospects for 10 more . \nWe sold only four pickers all last year  . \nGus Ehlers , competitor of Mr. Houtz in this farm community , says his business since August 1 is running 50 % above a year earlier . \n Before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20 %  , he says . \nThough the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas . \nParadoxically , the sales rise is due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm output . \nAlthough the Administration's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather , are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines . \n"}

Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . \n It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play  , he commented . \nBuchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . \n But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop  , he said . \nThe conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . \nThere have even been serious errors in the U.S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . \n The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries  , Buchheister told the delegates . \n\nEvery library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically ,  I 'm sorry , but we do n't have that book . \nThere would n't be much demand for it , I 'm afraid  . \nBehind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest . \nWhat to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles ? ? \nWhat to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ? \nMost library budgets are hopelessly inadequate . \nA startlingly high percentage do not exceed $ 500 annually , which includes the librarian's salary , and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world's richest city . \n\nAustin , Texas -- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's  abandoned property  act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . \nDaniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . \nUnder committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . \nBut questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . \nDaniel termed  extremely conservative  his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 . \nHe told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books  since Texas was a republic  . \nIt permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more . \nThe bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer . \n\nthe century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law . \nSeveral factors contributed to this change . \nThe Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow . \nHere in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . \nThus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century . \nInternational law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . \n\nCook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrested him . \nThinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him . \nEven while suffering the trip to his home , Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian . \nThree weeks later , following his recovery , armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney , Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez . \nArriving at daybreak , they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender . \nInstead , he whirled and ran to his house for a gun , forcing them to kill him , Cook reported . \nBoth Cook's and Russell's lives were threatened by the Mexicans following the killing , but the company officers felt that in the end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion . \nGeneral manager Pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the Mexicans in suspense rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away , and try to have a few punished . \n\nreasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . \nAnd this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . \nOne such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . \nHere , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . \nTwo major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . \nThe double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define  relative costs  , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . \n\nLondon , Feb. 9 -- Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine , the Dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire United States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today . \nThe Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year . \nIt is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs . \nIt has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy's Nautilus , the world's first atomic submarine . \nIts power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack . \nFive held for trial The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow St. police court here at the end of a three day hearing . \nA full trial was ordered for : Two British civil servants , Miss Ethel Gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , Harry Houghton , 55 , and divorced . \nThey are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard . \n\nResentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R.

; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section 381 ( c ) ( 16 ) ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section 381 ( c ) ( 6 ) ) , but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company ( section 381 ( c ) ( 14 ) ) , but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes ? ? \nThese items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . \nThere does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities . \nWith respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 ( c ) , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation . \nTo this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute . \nIt is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes . \n\nthe outlook for interest rates in 1961 , the question , as always , is the prospect for general business activity . \nBy and large , what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates . \nMoreover , the trend of general business activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal , monetary , and other Federal policies which affect interest rates . \nNineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business activity . \nDuring much of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a record-high plateau , but there have been persistent signs of slack in the economy . \nThe tendency for general business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident . \n\nthe care of five young children and concerned about persistent economic difficulties due to her husband's marginal income , her defense of denial was excessively strong . \nThus the lack of effective recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two babies showed signs of becoming a disabling problem . \nThe result , dramatically visible in a matter of days in the family's disrupted daily functioning , was a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would befall the second twin , whose birth had not been anticipated . \nSoon Mrs. B.'s fears threatened to burst into a full-blown panic concerning the welfare of the entire family . \nInability to care for the other children , difficulty in feeding the babies , who seemed colicky , bone-weary fatigue , repeated crying episodes , and short tempers reflected the family's helplessness in coping with the stressful situation . \nClearly , this was a family in crisis . \nMrs. B. compared her feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at the time of her mother's death when she was eight , as well as her subsequent anger at her father for remarrying . \nHer previous traumatic experiences flashed through her mind as if they had happened yesterday . \n\nit is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief  structuring  experience . \nIt was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal , concretistic reports of what the ambiguous figure  looked like  as reflecting their hesitancy about taking chances . \nThis was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action . \nResponses such as  rope with a loop in it  , and  two pieces of rope  , were quite characteristic . \nGuilford-Martin personality inventories . \nThe three personality inventories ( Guilford ; ; Guilford-Martin ; ; Guilford-Martin ) were filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects . \n\nit is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief  structuring  experience . \nIt was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal , concretistic reports of what the ambiguous figure  looked like  as reflecting their hesitancy about taking chances . \nThis was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action . \nResponses such as  rope with a loop in it  , and  two pieces of rope  , were quite characteristic . \nGuilford-Martin personality inventories . \nThe three personality inventories ( Guilford ;

Mrs. Reese baked her cookies for only the third time in the Bake-off finals . \nAnd the third time was the charm . \nShe dreamed up the cookie recipe , tried it , liked it and entered it in the contest . \n\n: talking and listening Though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week . \nHigh up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte . \nOn this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . \nIdeally , the President would like the French to agree on a  status quo ante  on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . \nTo continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . \nThe President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support . \n\nA band viscometer is shown in Figure 2 . \nIt consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims . \nThere is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed . \nA tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks . \nIn normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks . \nAfter it has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded . \nBy the use of various weights , data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtained . \nThe instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described . \n\nthe three main categories of antisubmarine warfare operations are defense of shipping , defense of naval forces , and area defense . \nThe last category overlaps the others in amphibious operations and near terminals and bases . \nTo effect these operations , five elements exist ( 1 ) surface , ( 2 ) air , ( 3 ) mines , ( 4 ) submarine , and ( 5 ) fixed installations . \nSurface forces have been used to provide defense zones around naval and merchant ship formations , air to furnish area surveillance , and mines for protection of limited areas . \nSubmarines and shore installations are new elements . \nThe submarine now has a definite place in submarine defense particularly in denying enemy access to ocean areas . \n\nthe effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) . \nB. Organification of iodine The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood . \nHowever , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . \nIn the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ; De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) . \nThis iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems . \nIn addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . \n\nSome of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . \nFirst , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . \nIn contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls . \nThe Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . \nSecond , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . \nAlthough the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . \nThird , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children . \nThe Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children . \n\nA variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies . \nThese include low-temperature ethanol ( Cohn ) fractionation , electrophoresis , ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses . \nModifications of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators . \nAbelson and Rawson , using a stepwise elution scheme , fractionated whole sera containing ABO and Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose . \nSpeer and coworkers , in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera , used a series of gradients for elution from Afj . \nFahey and Morrison used a single , continuous gradient at constant pH for the fractionation of anti-A and anti-B agglutinins from preisolated \\*\\* yg-globulin samples . \n\nThe Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves . \nGary Player , the small , trim South African , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap . \nArnold Palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief . \n Just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you  , Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament . \nAnd that is just what happened on the last few holes . \nThe Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer . \n\nTemperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85 - 90-degrees-F ( 29 - 32-degrees-C ) . \nThe top rolls are loaded with 40 lbs .. Sixty lbs. loading is possible but 40 lbs. is adequate . \nThe suds box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain pipe ( thus returning suds to soap box ) and the machine is started . \nThe 160-ml. bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is applied slowly and directly to the running specimen . \nWashing is continued for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips or passes through the squeeze rolls . \nAt the conclusion of the washing , 8 liters of water at 90-degrees-F ( 32 \\* 0C. ) are automatically metered from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs , 4 liters to each tub . \nThis operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes . \n\n2 : : Some of the major functions of religion The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; ; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . \nIn societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . \nWith the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . \nNevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . \nAlthough the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . \nIf the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . \nThere are several closely related inner functions . \nIn the last analysis , religion is the means of inducing , formulating , expressing , enhancing , implementing , and perpetuating man's deepest experience -- the religious . \n"}

Price Daniel's  abandoned property  act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . \nDaniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . \nUnder committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . \nBut questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . \nDaniel termed  extremely conservative  his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 . \nHe told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books  since Texas was a republic  . \nIt permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more . \nThe bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer . \n\nit is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief  structuring  experience . \nIt was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal , concretistic reports of what the ambiguous figure  looked like  as reflecting their hesitancy about taking chances . \nThis was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action . \nResponses such as  rope with a loop in it  , and  two pieces of rope  , were quite characteristic . \nGuilford-Martin personality inventories . \nThe three personality inventories ( Guilford ;

Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . \n It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play  , he commented . \nBuchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . \n But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop  , he said . \nThe conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . \nThere have even been serious errors in the U.S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . \n The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries  , Buchheister told the delegates . \nIn addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying , Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness bill , creation of national seashore parks , including Point Reyes ; ; preservation of the wetlands where birds breed ; ; a pesticides co-ordination act ; ; stronger water pollution control programs , and Federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil . \n\nartists , indeed , turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . \nTo speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . \nAt the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . \nTheir world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . \nAnd perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . \nThe storms of the past had died away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men's minds . \n\nRecent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M.D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel's impact resides in its  allegoric insight and moral metaphor  . \nJ.H. Miller's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . \nIn his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . \nThis essay seeks to make that exploration . \nDickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . \nHe knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response . \n\nemotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man , in addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex . \nIn experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex , the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated . \nMoreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions . \nEven more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress . \nA previously extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges . \nIt seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo - and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism . \nIn addition , the neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky's interesting experiment on the  communication of affect  demonstrates . \nBut even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat , sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex . \n"}

John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws . \nOnce more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally . \nOr , in the words of Anatole France ,  The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges  . \nThe public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites . \nThe Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program . \nIn addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill . \nIt is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers ' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike . \n\nbriefly , the topping configuration must be examined for its inferences . \nThen the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had further forecasting significance . \nAnd then the application of the count rules to the width ( horizontally ) of the configuration gives us an intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline . \nThe very idea of there being  count rules  implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway ( run up or run down ) movement . \nThis expectation is what really  sold  point and figure . \nBut there is no positive and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense . \n\nIt is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels . \nNo single explanation is adequate to account for this . \nImprovement , however , is urgent , and at least three things will be needed . \nThe first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses . \nEven beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant systems , both in their general outlines and in many specific details . \nAn advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems , including some of the more unusual types . \n\nThe following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the operands of those instructions which refer to the particular items : channel , unit , combined channel and unit , combined arm and file , unit record synchronizers , inquiry synchronizers , and alteration switches . \nThe declarative operation EQU is used to equate symbolic names to item numbers ( see page 85 ) . \nContinuation cards Certain Autocoder statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained in the operand ( columns 21 - 75 ) of a single line on the Autocoder coding sheet . \nWhen this is the case , the appropriate section of this manual will indicate that  Continuation Cards  may be used . \nThus , when specifically permitted , the operand of a given line on the Autocoder coding sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to four additional lines which immediately follow . \nThe label and operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand must begin in column 21 ; ; i.e. , it must be left-justified in the operand column of the coding sheet . \nThe operand need not extend across the entire operand column of either the header card or continuation cards but may end with the comma following any parameter . \n\nTemperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85 - 90-degrees-F ( 29 - 32-degrees-C ) . \nThe top rolls are loaded with 40 lbs .. Sixty lbs. loading is possible but 40 lbs. is adequate . \nThe suds box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain pipe ( thus returning suds to soap box ) and the machine is started . \nThe 160-ml. bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is applied slowly and directly to the running specimen . \nWashing is continued for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips or passes through the squeeze rolls . \nAt the conclusion of the washing , 8 liters of water at 90-degrees-F ( 32 \\* 0C. ) are automatically metered from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs , 4 liters to each tub . \n\nPurification of the conjugates In attempting to improve specificity of staining , the fluorescein-labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways : ( 1 ) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders ( Coons , 1958 ) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( E.F. Smith & Townsend ) on sweet clover stems . \n( 2 ) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 - 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems . \nThe proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of Afj in Afj to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80 % saturation with Afj . \nThe precipitate was washed twice with an 80 % saturated solution of Afj , dissolved in a small quantity of 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer , dialyzed against cold distilled water till free from ammonium ions , and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen . \n( 3 ) In other experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade ( 1957 ) . \n( 4 ) The conjugates were passed through a diethylaminoethyl ( DEAE ) cellulose column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer ( PBS ) containing Afj potassium phosphate and Afj . \nPreparation of frozen sections The technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that described by Coons et al ( 1951 ) . \n\nthe effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) . \nB.

Bowden stated . \nBut an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes . \nThe statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated . \n Emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions  , the statement said . \nThe statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation . \n"}

second month in a row , Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday . \nIt is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . \nWilliam Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $ 58,918 out of its budgeted $ 66,000 in the category , leaving only $ 7,082 for the rest of the month . \nAt the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $ 17,000 . \nBut it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . \nNo request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . \nBoard oks pact The commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , Roy Webster , of Hood River , and Dr. Ennis Keizer , of North Bend , approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past . \nThe contract with Ray Field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $ 8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month . \n\nCook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrested him . \nThinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him . \nEven while suffering the trip to his home , Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian . \nThree weeks later , following his recovery , armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney , Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez . \nArriving at daybreak , they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender . \nInstead , he whirled and ran to his house for a gun , forcing them to kill him , Cook reported . \nBoth Cook's and Russell's lives were threatened by the Mexicans following the killing , but the company officers felt that in the end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion . \nGeneral manager Pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the Mexicans in suspense rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away , and try to have a few punished . \n\nartists , indeed , turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . \nTo speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . \nAt the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . \nTheir world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . \nAnd perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . \nThe storms of the past had died away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men's minds . \nThroughout the work of the later ninth century a calm , severe serenity displays itself . \n\nA proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline Afj as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented . \nAfj is paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening . \nThe lines are asymmetric and over the range of field Afj gauss and temperature Afj the asymmetry increases with increasing Afj and decreasing T . \nAn isotropic resonance shift of Afj to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction . \nThe general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment Afj of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized to Afj . \nThe theory predicts a linear dependence of Afj on Afj , where J is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss constant . \nThe experimental second moment Afj conforms to the relation Afj in agreement with theory . \nHence , the electron paramagnetic effects ( slope ) can be separated from the nuclear effects ( intercept ) . \n\nAbstract Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) . \nThus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . \nIt was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy . \nA detailed energy balance of the anode was established . \nThe anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount . \nThe dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Afj . \n\nbriefly , the topping configuration must be examined for its inferences . \nThen the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had further forecasting significance . \nAnd then the application of the count rules to the width ( horizontally ) of the configuration gives us an intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline . \nThe very idea of there being  count rules  implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway ( run up or run down ) movement . \nThis expectation is what really  sold  point and figure . \nBut there is no positive and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense . \nExperience will show that only the vaguest generalities apply , and in fine , these merely dwell upon a relationship between the durations and intensities of events . \nAfter all , too much does not happen too suddenly , nor does very little take long . \n\nthe eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture . \nThrough 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . \nTo reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . \nIn certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . \nThese areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . \nThe accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . \nThe process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion . \nIt was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint . \n"}

Sprinkel , economist of Harris Trust & Savings Bank , Chicago , predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn. , California group , conference . \nAnother speaker , William H. Draper , Jr. , former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper , Gaither & Anderson , urged the U.S. to  throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we wo n't be pushed around any more  . \nHe urged support for President Kennedy's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations . \n' not flash in pan ' Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a  temporary flash in the pan  but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern . \n In view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial  he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but  there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960  . \nThesis refuted Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism  is based on very limited and questionable evidence  . \nRather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth  , he said  it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery  . \nDanger cited He cautioned that  the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation  . \n\nThese societies can expect to face difficult times . \nAs the historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum , their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces , the gaps between rulers and subjects , town and country , will widen ; ; new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence ; ; old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense of direction . \nNational leaders will have to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men's sense of identity . \nFeelings of a community of interest will have to be recreated -- in some of the new nations , indeed , they must be built for the first time -- on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not rely only on shared memories of the past . \nNevertheless , with foresight and careful planning , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing through this stage can be escaped . \nThe United States can help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible . \n\nsentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . \nThe tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . \nThere is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes . \nThus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley's hymns are as follows . \n A charge to keep I have , A God to glorify  . \nIn the tune to which this hymn is most often sung ,  Boylston  , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have . \n\nthe Midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas . \nThe high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume . \nResearch at Fayette , Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg with loadings from 8 to 120 lb . \nSince experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds . \nRecent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer . \nTheir study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen hr . \nhp . \n. \n\nthe honeybee , practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor . \nOccasionally , you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning over sods in your garden , but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all . \nThey keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt . \nI must add at once that these animals are what we call  queens  , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn . \nIt is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold weather . \nEven some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease . \nThe survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50-degrees and there is not too much wind . \n"}

Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week . \nHigh up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte . \nOn this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . \nIdeally , the President would like the French to agree on a  status quo ante  on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . \nTo continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . \nThe President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support . \nThe conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable . \nThrough Ladgham , Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba ; ; and one U.S. official said :  The key question now is which side picks up the phone first  . \n\nA royal decree issued in 1910 , two years after the Belgian government assumed authority for the administration of the Congo , prescribed the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms . \nFurther decrees along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919 . \nIn 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the Governor-General , and the periodic compilation of these records was ordered . \nBut specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors . \nA unified set of regulations , applicable to all areas , was issued in 1929 , and a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was instituted at the same time . \nThe whole system was again reviewed and reorganized in 1933 . \nGeneral responsibility for its administration rested with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs , Service des Affaires Indigenes et de la Main-d'Oeuvre ( AIMO , Afj Direction , Afj Direction Generale , Gouvernement Generale ) . \n\nbriefly , the topping configuration must be examined for its inferences . \nThen the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had further forecasting significance . \nAnd then the application of the count rules to the width ( horizontally ) of the configuration gives us an intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline . \nThe very idea of there being  count rules  implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway ( run up or run down ) movement . \nThis expectation is what really  sold  point and figure . \nBut there is no positive and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense . \nExperience will show that only the vaguest generalities apply , and in fine , these merely dwell upon a relationship between the durations and intensities of events . \nAfter all , too much does not happen too suddenly , nor does very little take long . \n\nLos Angeles in 1957 finally bowed to the skyscraper . \n) And without high density in the core , rapid-transit systems can not be maintained economically , let alone built from scratch at today's prices . \nHowever , the building of freeways and garages can not continue forever . \nThe new interchange among the four Los Angeles freeways , including the grade-constructed accesses , occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land , one-eighth of a square mile , an area about the size of Rockefeller Center in New York . \nIt is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law calls  the highest and best use  of centrally located urban land . \nAs it affects the city's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ; ; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services . \nSubways improved land values without taking away land ; ; freeways boost valuation less ( because the garages they require are not prime buildings by a long shot ) , and reduce the acreage that can be taxed . \n\nreasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . \nAnd this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . \nOne such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . \nHere , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . \nTwo major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 . \nThe double-step type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define  relative costs  , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice . \n\nSentiment . \nTension management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling . \nOne of the devices for tension management is preferential mating . \nThe preferential mating of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study . \nThe relative geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating . \nIt would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society . \nThe supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation . \nThe newlyweds building homes on the same land with either set of parents , and the almost exclusive use of members of the population as sponsors for baptisms and weddings illustrate this supportive relationship . \n\nOslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . \nThis has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . \nIn Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems . \nThis atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the  colonialist  powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . \nThe nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . \nExplosion avoided In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . \n\na few years , foamed plastics materials have managed to grow into an integral , and important , phase of the plastics industry -- and the end is still not yet in sight . \nUrethane foam , as only one example , was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955 . \nYet last year's volume probably topped 100 million lb. and expectations are for a market of 275 million lb. by 1964 . \nMany of the other foamed plastics , particularly the styrenes , show similar growth potential . \nAnd there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be evaluated . \nAs this issue goes to press , for example , one manufacturer has announced an epoxy foam with outstanding buoyancy and impact strength ; ; another reports that a cellular polypropylene , primarily for use in wire coating applications , is being investigated . \nOn the following pages , each of the major commercial foamed plastics is described in detail , as to properties , applications , and methods of processing . \n\nthe statement empirical , for goodness was not a quality like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard . \nWhat were they to do , then , with these awkward judgments of value ? ? \nTo find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically , and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery . \nIt appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only . \nIf it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at all , that they asserted nothing true or false , but merely expressed emotions like  Hurrah  or  Fiddlesticks  , then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads could be at rest . \nThis is the course the positivists took . \n\nThere are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory . \nMollusks are a case in point . \nThe shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . \nThough this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . \nThere can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . \nThe deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . \nBy way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence . \nThere is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture . \n"}

? \nIf we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems . \nFirst , T may not have a single characteristic value ; ; this is really a deficiency in the scalar field , namely , that it is not algebraically closed . \n\nThe many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc . \n. \nA significant reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly inflected language such as Russian . \nFor English the reduction in size is less striking . \nThis approach requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word . \nThe logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file . \n\nthe outlook for interest rates in 1961 , the question , as always , is the prospect for general business activity . \nBy and large , what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates . \nMoreover , the trend of general business activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal , monetary , and other Federal policies which affect interest rates . \nNineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business activity . \nDuring much of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a record-high plateau , but there have been persistent signs of slack in the economy . \nThe tendency for general business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident . \nAlthough the pause in the advance of general business activity this year has thus far been quite modest , it is hard to escape the conclusion that the softening process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 and possibly somewhat longer . \n\nThe Sane Society is an ambitious work . \nIts scope is as broad as the question : What does it mean to live in modern society ?

Draper , Jr. , former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper , Gaither & Anderson , urged the U.S. to  throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we wo n't be pushed around any more  . \nHe urged support for President Kennedy's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations . \n' not flash in pan ' Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a  temporary flash in the pan  but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern . \n In view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial  he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but  there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960  . \nThesis refuted Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism  is based on very limited and questionable evidence  . \n\nMany other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length . \nLaurence M.

? \nWhat to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ? \nMost library budgets are hopelessly inadequate . \nA startlingly high percentage do not exceed $ 500 annually , which includes the librarian's salary , and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world's richest city . \n\nthe honeybee , practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor . \nOccasionally , you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning over sods in your garden , but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all . \nThey keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt . \nI must add at once that these animals are what we call  queens  , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn . \nIt is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold weather . \nEven some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease . \nThe survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50-degrees and there is not too much wind . \n\nit was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies . \nIt was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies , and with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other . \n5 . \nPoland frontiers . \nWhen the Yalta Conference opened , the American policy of postponing all discussion of Russia's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down . \nStarting in great force late in December , from a line stretching from East Prussia to Budapest , the Red armies had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the Oder , thirty miles from Berlin , and the Upper Danube region was being rapidly overrun , while the Western Allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine . \nThe long delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia's advantage . \n\n9 . \nMartin and Stendler present evidence that infants and young children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual level simply by combining objects and counting them . \nAfter they have developed concepts , they are free from the necessity of manipulating objects ; ; they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely . \nThe ability to think seems to increase consistently with age . \nOne experiment showed the greatest one-year difference occurring between the eleventh and twelfth years . \n10 . \nMany studies indicate that elementary-school children's interests cover the whole field of science ; ; that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes and events ; ; and that as they mature their interests and capabilities change and broaden . \n\nGreer Garson , world-famous star of stage , screen and television , will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has created a high standard in her profession . \nAs a Neiman-Marcus award winner the titian-haired Miss Garson is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion this season . \nShe will receive the 1961  Oscar  at the 24th annual Neiman-Marcus Exposition , Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel . \nThe only woman recipient , Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando Sarmi , creator of chic , beautiful women's fashions ; ; Harry Rolnick , president of the Byer-Rolnick Hat Corporation and designer of men's hats ; ; Sydney Wragge , creator of sophisticated casuals for women and Roger Vivier , designer of Christian Dior shoes Paris , France , whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized the shoe industry . \nThe silver and ebony plaques will be presented at noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus , president of Neiman-Marcus , Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas Society for Crippled Children Cerebral Palsy Treatment Center . \nThe attractive Greer Garson , who loves beautiful clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles , prefers timeless classical designs . \nOccasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for a fun piece simply because  It's unlike me  . \nIn private life , Miss Garson is Mrs. E.E.

; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . \nThere are several closely related inner functions . \n\nTwo metabolites ( 1 , and 2 ) ) of p-aminobenzoic acid ( PABA ) which act as cofactors for the hydroxylation of aniline by acid-fast bacteria are biosynthesized from Afj . \nThe 7 carbons of PABA are incorporated directly into metabolite 2 ( ( as shown with both ring-labeled and carboxy-labeled Afj ) . \nThirty-five of the 36 carbon atoms arise from Afj . \nAll 28 carbons of metabolite 1 ( ( a product of mild acid hydrolysis of 2 ) arise from Afj . \nMetabolite 1 , isolated from the medium , however , showed a lower specific activity , which indicates endogenous synthesis of this metabolite . \nVigorous acid hydrolysis of metabolite 1 , destroyed the biological activity of the compound and liberated two aryl amines . \nFragment A has been obtained in crystalline form as a dioxalate salt and free base . \n"}

J .. Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are uncommon , although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago . \nThis acquisition is a matched , perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long , plus six sidechairs and two armchairs . \nThe AID has undertaken the redecoration of the White House library as a project in connection with the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for the presidential home . \nIt is the AID's intention to create in the library  a miniature museum of Americana  before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall . \n\nThe vast Central Valley of California is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world . \nDuring the summer of 1960 , it became the setting for a bitter and basic labor-management struggle . \nThe contestants in this economic struggle are the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee ( AWOC ) of the AFL-CIO and the agricultural employers of the State . \nBy virtue of the legal responsibilities of the Department of Employment in the farm placement program , we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces . \nIt is not a pleasant or easy position , but one we have endeavored to maintain . \nWe have sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties , but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose . \n\nHigh-gain , photoelectronic image intensification is applied under conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time required by a sensor or recording instrument exceeds the limits of practicability . \nExamples of such situations are ( aerial ) night reconnaissance , the recording of radioactive tracers in live body tissues , special radiography in medical or industrial applications , track recording of high energy particles , etc .. High-gain photoelectronic image intensification may be achieved by several methods ; ; some of these are listed below : ( A ) Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems , ( B ) Channel-type , secondary emission image intensifier , ( C ) Image intensifier based upon the  multipactor  principle , ( D ) Transmission secondary electron multiplication image intensifiers ( TSEM tubes ) , ( E ) Cascading of single stages , enclosed in one common envelope . \nCascading single stages by coupling lens systems is rather inefficient as the lens systems limit the obtainable gain quite severely . \nChannel-type image intensifiers are capable of achieving high-gain values ; ; they suffer , however , from an inherently low resolution . \nImage intensifiers based upon the multipactor principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable resolution is concerned . \nHowever , the unavoidable low-duty cycle restricts the effective gain . \n\nthe Midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas . \nThe high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume . \nResearch at Fayette , Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg with loadings from 8 to 120 lb . \nSince experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds . \nRecent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer . \nTheir study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen hr . \n\nThe set of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy . \nAn optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product . \nThere are thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The specification of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired . \nFor a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream . \nFor the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter . \nThe objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ; ; it is the subject of Chapter 4 . \n\nAn analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts . \nFirst is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion . \nPreparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes . \nAll political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination . \nThe second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting . \nConsiderable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach . \nHowever , the regionally differentiated results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances . \n\nitself in the sands of the 19th Century , the grand stream of Italian Renaissance architectural decoration made a last appearance in the Brumidi frescos of the Capitol Rotunda in Washington . \nThe artistic generation after Brumidi was trained in the Paris of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution , and tended to overlook greatness of conception where faults and weakness were easy to find . \nBut it is a great conception . \nThe open ceiling , with allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky : the closed frieze , formally divided into historical scenes and tightly tied to the stone walls , belong in their large ordering to the line of Correggio and his Baroque followers . \nThe descent may be remote , but this is surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance in the United States . \nConstantino Brumidi designed the decorative scheme as a whole , in collaboration with the architect Charles U. Walter , at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of Bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure . \n"}
