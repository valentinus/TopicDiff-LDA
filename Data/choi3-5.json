Smith & Townsend ) on sweet clover stems . \n( 2 ) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 - 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems . \nThe proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of Afj in Afj to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80 % saturation with Afj . \n\nIntroduction . \nIn 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers . \nThese are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol Afj . \nThen in 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( A ) It has no complex of invariant lines , and ( B ) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1 . \nNo generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible . \n\nSome who have written on Utopia have treated it as  a learned diversion of a learned world  ,  a phantasy with which More amused himself  ,  a holiday work , a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high spirits , a revel of debate , paradox , comedy and invention  . \nWith respect to this view , two points are worth making . \nFirst , it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as  festivus  ,  gay  . \n\nRecent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M.D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel's impact resides in its  allegoric insight and moral metaphor  . \nJ.H. Miller's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . \nIn his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . \n"}

Price Daniel's  abandoned property  act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . \nDaniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . \nUnder committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . \n\nIntroduction . \nIn 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers . \nThese are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol Afj . \nThen in 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( A ) It has no complex of invariant lines , and ( B ) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1 . \nNo generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible . \n\n1 . \nIntroduction It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres . \nThe results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . \nWhen sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . \nObservations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface . \n\none explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium ( section 381 ( c ) ( 9 ) ) , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section 381 ( c ) ( 16 ) ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section 381 ( c ) ( 6 ) ) , but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company ( section 381 ( c ) ( 14 ) ) , but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes ? ? \nThese items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . \nThere does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities . \nWith respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 ( c ) , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation . \nTo this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute . \n"}

Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates . \nAt the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable . \nSome anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years . \n\nthe effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) . \nB.

Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . \nIdeally , the President would like the French to agree on a  status quo ante  on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . \nTo continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . \n\nit is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief  structuring  experience . \nIt was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal , concretistic reports of what the ambiguous figure  looked like  as reflecting their hesitancy about taking chances . \nThis was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action . \nResponses such as  rope with a loop in it  , and  two pieces of rope  , were quite characteristic . \n\nAbstract Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) . \nThus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . \nIt was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy . \n\nThe injured German veteran was a former miner , twenty-four years old , who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head . \nThis resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also . \nIn any event , the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became  psychically blind  , while at the same time , apparently , the sense of touch remained essentially intact . \nPsychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images , a condition in which , for example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence . \n\nThe preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined by the sociologist . \nLike primitive numbers in mathematics , the entire axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth . \nBut what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduces the idea of physical models ? ? \n"}

? \nTo find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically , and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery . \nIt appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only . \nIf it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at all , that they asserted nothing true or false , but merely expressed emotions like  Hurrah  or  Fiddlesticks  , then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads could be at rest . \n\nThe bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout . \nThe pulmonary vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type 1 , , follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( figs. 8 , 22 ) . \nAnother marked difference is noted here . \nThe pulmonary artery , in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveoli , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura ( fig. 8 ) . \nThe bronchial artery , except for a small number of short branches in the hilum , contributes none of the pleural blood supply . \n\nA philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . \nBut a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . \nThe man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . \nBy force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . \nThis is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . \n\ninvisible , modern revolt , like X-rays and radioactivity , is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels , where it is called delinquency . \n Disaffiliation  , by the way , is the term used by the critic and poet , Lawrence Lipton , who has written several articles on this subject , the first of which , in The Nation , quoted as Epigraph :  We disaffiliate . \n -- John L.

High-gain photoelectronic image intensification may be achieved by several methods ; ; some of these are listed below : ( A ) Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems , ( B ) Channel-type , secondary emission image intensifier , ( C ) Image intensifier based upon the  multipactor  principle , ( D ) Transmission secondary electron multiplication image intensifiers ( TSEM tubes ) , ( E ) Cascading of single stages , enclosed in one common envelope . \nCascading single stages by coupling lens systems is rather inefficient as the lens systems limit the obtainable gain quite severely . \n\na few years , foamed plastics materials have managed to grow into an integral , and important , phase of the plastics industry -- and the end is still not yet in sight . \nUrethane foam , as only one example , was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955 . \nYet last year's volume probably topped 100 million lb. and expectations are for a market of 275 million lb. by 1964 . \n\nAnglo-Saxon and Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age . \nHrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at Finnsburg ( lines 1068 - 1159 ) , and improvises the tale of Beowulf's exploits in a complimentary comparison of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund ( lines 871 - 892 ) ; ; Alcinous ' court bard sings of the discovered adultery of Ares and Aphrodite ( Odyssey 8 266-366 ) , and takes up a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens on ( Odyssey 8 499-520 ) . \nNothing in all this is autobiographical : unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith , the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ; the poet of The Odyssey , reputed blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel Demodocus . \nSince none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter , there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition . \nThat such a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey , at least , is hard to deny . \n\nindividual classes of foods differ in their requirements for preservation , a number of methods have been developed over the years involving one or a combination of procedures such as dehydration , fermentation , salting , chemical treatment , canning , refrigeration , and freezing . \nThe basic objectives in each instance are to make available supplies of food during the intervals between harvesting or slaughter , to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and insects , and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of harvest or production to areas of consumption . \nIn earlier years , the preservation of food was essentially related to survival . \n\nthe century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law . \nSeveral factors contributed to this change . \nThe Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow . \nHere in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . \nThus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century . \n"}

Draper , Jr. , former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper , Gaither & Anderson , urged the U.S. to  throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we wo n't be pushed around any more  . \nHe urged support for President Kennedy's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations . \n' not flash in pan ' Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a  temporary flash in the pan  but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern . \n In view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial  he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but  there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960  . \n\nThe nation the three-front war At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad . \nAfterward , Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen . \nWhat Herter presented , said Gore , was  not a very encouraging review  . \nThat was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts . \n\nAnglo-Saxon and Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age . \nHrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at Finnsburg ( lines 1068 - 1159 ) , and improvises the tale of Beowulf's exploits in a complimentary comparison of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund ( lines 871 - 892 ) ; ; Alcinous ' court bard sings of the discovered adultery of Ares and Aphrodite ( Odyssey 8 266-366 ) , and takes up a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens on ( Odyssey 8 499-520 ) . \nNothing in all this is autobiographical : unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith , the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ; the poet of The Odyssey , reputed blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel Demodocus . \nSince none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter , there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition . \n\nPurification of the conjugates In attempting to improve specificity of staining , the fluorescein-labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways : ( 1 ) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders ( Coons , 1958 ) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( E.F. Smith & Townsend ) on sweet clover stems . \n( 2 ) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 - 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems . \nThe proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of Afj in Afj to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80 % saturation with Afj . \n\nThere are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts . \nThis may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both . \nThe differentiation , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . \n( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . \n\none characteristic distinguishes Boris Godunov , it is the consistency with which every person on the stage -- including the chorus -- comes alive in the music . \nMuch of this lifelike quality results from Mussorgsky's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections . \nIn this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera ; ; such composers as Monteverdi , Lully and Purcell , with the same goal in mind , had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages . \nThrough long experimentation in his songs , Mussorgsky developed a Russian recitative as different from others as the language itself . \n\nsentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . \nThe tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . \nThere is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes . \nThus the first lines of one of Charles Wesley's hymns are as follows . \n\nOslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . \nThis has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . \nIn Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems . \nThis atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the  colonialist  powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . \n\nA gyro-stabilized platform system , using restrained gyros , is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the gyro-platform-servo combination . \nThe restrained gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion , neglecting transient effects , as follows : Afj where U is a torque applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro . \nThe platform angle \\*\\* yf is the angle about which the gyro is controlling . \nThis is normally termed the gyro input axis , 90-degrees away from the gyro output or \\*\\* yj axis . \n\nAnglo-Saxon and Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age . \nHrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at Finnsburg ( lines 1068 - 1159 ) , and improvises the tale of Beowulf's exploits in a complimentary comparison of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund ( lines 871 - 892 ) ; ; Alcinous ' court bard sings of the discovered adultery of Ares and Aphrodite ( Odyssey 8 266-366 ) , and takes up a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens on ( Odyssey 8 499-520 ) . \nNothing in all this is autobiographical : unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith , the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ; the poet of The Odyssey , reputed blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel Demodocus . \nSince none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter , there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition . \nThat such a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey , at least , is hard to deny . \n"}

Organification of iodine The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood . \nHowever , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . \n\nRecent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M.D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel's impact resides in its  allegoric insight and moral metaphor  . \nJ.H. Miller's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective . \nIn his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . \nThis essay seeks to make that exploration . \nDickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers . \n\ncrucial encounter One of the initial questions put to President Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev . \nMr. Kennedy replied :  I 'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground  . \nThe President knew that a confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable . \nBut he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting . \n"}

Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes , and Charles C. Carpenter's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes ( Thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults . \nFelix Kopstein states that  when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length  , but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity . \nIt is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity ; ; he was working with species of Java , so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect . \n\nAbstract Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) . \nThus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . \nIt was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy . \nA detailed energy balance of the anode was established . \n\na simple , closed , plane curve C which is a real-analytic image of the unit circle , and which is given by Afj . \nThese are real analytic periodic functions with period T . \nIn the following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares . \nThis theorem is similar to the theorem of Kakutani that there exists a circumscribing cube around any closed , bounded convex set in Afj . \nThe latter theorem has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo , and Cairns to show that in Afj there are families of such cubes . \n"}

; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . \nIn societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . \nWith the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . \nNevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . \nAlthough the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences . \n\n1 . \nIntroduction It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres . \nThe results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . \nWhen sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . \n\nSome of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . \nFirst , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . \nIn contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls . \nThe Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . \n\nA variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies . \nThese include low-temperature ethanol ( Cohn ) fractionation , electrophoresis , ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses . \nModifications of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators . \nAbelson and Rawson , using a stepwise elution scheme , fractionated whole sera containing ABO and Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose . \nSpeer and coworkers , in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera , used a series of gradients for elution from Afj . \n\nThe Summary Report On Desegregation Progress In Education In The Middle-South Region , 1959 - 1960  clearly shows two pieces of information . \nThe Summary Report , which was prepared for this Conference , indicates , first , that actual or pending school desegregation is increasing ;

? \nA work so broad , even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed by a moral vision , must necessarily  fail  . \n\nAbstract Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) . \nThus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . \nIt was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy . \nA detailed energy balance of the anode was established . \n\n1 . \nIntroduction It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres . \nThe results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . \nWhen sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . \n\nthe Midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas . \nThe high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume . \nResearch at Fayette , Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg with loadings from 8 to 120 lb . \nSince experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds . \nRecent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer . \n\nthe eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture . \nThrough 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . \nTo reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . \nIn certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . \nThese areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . \n\nA philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . \nBut a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . \nThe man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . \nBy force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . \n\nA philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . \nBut a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . \nThe man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . \nBy force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . \nThis is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . \n"}

Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday . \nThe disclosure by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial . \nBellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan Clements , 30 , a separate trial . \n\nOslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . \nThis has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . \nIn Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems . \nThis atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the  colonialist  powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . \n\nHotel Escape's Bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction , the versatile  Kings 4 , Plus Two  . \nThis is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while -- a well integrated , fast moving outfit specializing in skits , vocals , comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch . \nShow spotlights the Kings -- George Worth , Bill Kay , Frank Ciciulla and Gene Wilson , flanked by Dave Grossman and Ron Stevens . \n\nThe plant was located west of the Battenkill and south of the location of the former electric light plant . \nThe Manchester Depot Sewer Company issued 214 shares of stock at $ 10 each for construction of a sewer in that locality , and assessments were made for its maintenance . \nIt has given considerable trouble at times and empties right into the Battenkill . \nFire District No. 1 discussed its possible purchase in 1945 , but considered it an unwise investment . \n\nThe set of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy . \nAn optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product . \nThere are thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The specification of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired . \nFor a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream . \nFor the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter . \n\nbriefly , the topping configuration must be examined for its inferences . \nThen the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had further forecasting significance . \nAnd then the application of the count rules to the width ( horizontally ) of the configuration gives us an intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline . \nThe very idea of there being  count rules  implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway ( run up or run down ) movement . \nThis expectation is what really  sold  point and figure . \n\nThe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.M. next Saturday . \nThe current monthly payroll comes to about $ 15,000,000 . \nHoward E.

Wayne Dumont Jr . \nR-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel . \nThe controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club . \n\nthe outlook for interest rates in 1961 , the question , as always , is the prospect for general business activity . \nBy and large , what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates . \nMoreover , the trend of general business activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal , monetary , and other Federal policies which affect interest rates . \n\nthis evidence in mind , the writer began to plan how he might more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes . \nToward the end of the semester's work , he interviewed every married class member at great length . \nHe found , as he had suspected , a general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed course was not really functional for these students . \nHowever , all admitted that the  hindsight  was not altogether lost . \nIn their own words , it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they had gotten into their marriages , and perhaps they had obtained some insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time . \n\nAbstract Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) . \nThus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . \nIt was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy . \nA detailed energy balance of the anode was established . \nThe anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount . \n"}
